Key Pillars of Talent Acquisition Strategy for Automotive Industry
The automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transformation, driven by advancements in technology and automation. Acquiring top talent is crucial in this dynamic sector given the significant demand for skilled professionals who are well-versed in robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). Crafting a talent acquisition and management strategy designed specifically for this ever-changing landscape is not only necessary, but it also forms the basis of success. In this blog, we will explore the ways that challenge traditional approaches, shedding light on how to attract the brightest minds in the automotive industry.
1. Data-Driven Talent Mapping - Exposing the Talent Ecosystem
Talent acquisition and management in the automotive sector calls for data-driven approaches because this is where analytics prowess truly shines today. According to a LinkedIn study, 73% of recruiters consider hiring based on skills a priority. By deploying sophisticated algorithms and predictive analytics, recruiters can map out talent ecosystems, identifying individuals with unique expertise in technology plus industry relevant expertise. Market trends analysis, competitor insights, and talent mobility patterns give a silver platter advantage in acquiring talent.
2. AI-Powered Candidate Screening - Efficiency through Automation
Automotive companies can leverage AI-driven screening tools to source new employees. Research shows that 56% of HR leaders use AI-powered tools for talent acquisition and management purposes. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms scan resumes, GitHub repositories, and technical forums, allowing candidates with relevant skills to be identified together with open-source contributions, etc. Automating screening saves time for recruiters, thus making it possible to concentrate efforts on interactions with those with the highest probability of passing hiring processes.
3. Hackathons and Tech Challenges - Cultivating Innovation Hubs
Hosting hackathons or tech challenges is an effective strategy for attracting top talent in the automotive industry. It helps in mastering new technologies and tools. By providing real-world automation tasks as well as granting access to cutting-edge tools and datasets, businesses can effectively measure such candidates' problem-solving skills, creativity, and adaptability. These events work like talent magnets, attracting many enthusiastic individuals who want to show what they are capable of.
4. Open Source Contribution Analysis - Embracing Collaborative Communities
Open-source contributions shed light on the candidates' abilities and community involvement. The Linux Foundation and edX's survey reported that 93% of hiring managers face difficulty in finding open-source contributions, highlighting the increasing demand for skilled professionals in this area. It is possible to gauge the extent of knowledge the candidate has about several subjects, including specific programming languages, through analyzing their GitHub profiles, Stack Overflow activities, or forum participation. This facilitates a culture of knowledge sharing and teamwork.
5. Reverse Engineering Competitor Talent - Leveraging Competitive Intelligence
In the competitive automotive industry, understanding competitor talent is strategic. According to Talent Tech Labs' report, companies use talent intelligence tools to make data-driven decisions and address challenges like managing high-volume data from multiple sources. Recruiters interested in identifying key talents can use reverse engineering methods that entail understanding other company's staff composition. Understanding skill sets and career trajectories enables tailoring recruitment efforts to attract and retain top talent, gaining a competitive edge.
Conclusion
Traditional talent acquisition and management approaches fall short as the automotive industry strives for engineering excellence. Adopting tailored strategies offers a blueprint for next-gen talent acquisition. This blueprint fuels innovation, turning automotive companies into future leaders in this era of automotive evolution.

Home Blog Cybersecurity Challenges In BFSI Digital Infrastructure
06-13-2024
Cybersecurity Challenges in BFSI Digital Infrastructure
Financial institutions are main targets for cyber attacks. This is a severe concern given that a cyberattack occurs every 39 seconds (quicker than tying your shoelaces)! According to Netscout, there were nearly 7.9 million DDoS attacks, averaging 44,000 attacks per day in the first half of 2023. IBM reported the frequency of ransomware breaches surged by 41% last year, prolonging the time it takes to identify and contain them by an additional 49 days. Meanwhile, the average global cost of a data breach climbed to USD 4.45 million in 2023, representing a 15% increase over three years. These attacks are becoming more common and sophisticated, meaning businesses need to rethink their IT security strategies, such as leveraging IaaS (IT infrastructure as a service) to keep up.
The Need for Enhanced Cybersecurity in Banking
Cybersecurity has become more critical than ever for financial institutions since there are attacks from state-sponsored groups to individual opportunists using malware that is readily available off-the-shelf. Cybersecurity measures need to be given priority because just one vulnerable endpoint could result in a successful breach by hackers into their data and assets.
Leveraging Advanced Security Tools
Organizations can defend themselves against these threats through cloud-first tools that adopt a 'bottom-up' model of security based on identities, Zero Trust approach, etc., for robust protection against cyber-attacks. These technologies guard data and devices by implementing real-time decentralized security to detect and respond to threats before they become significant issues. For instance, by incorporating IaaS (IT infrastructure as a service), organizations can further enhance their security posture by leveraging the provider's advanced security measures and expertise in managing and securing IT infrastructure.
Challenges for Financial Services Companies
Cyber criminals have become more familiar with BFSI policies and procedures, making them prime targets for high-level cyber attacks. Hackers target financial services firms for data and asset portfolios. They use network vulnerabilities to steal cash and information, emphasizing the urgency for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. More often than not, the incentive behind the attack is monetary value. Still, in other circumstances, it may be a disruption where hostile countries get involved in digital espionage campaigns to gain political advantage over rivals. Among others, phishing remains the most prevalent cybercrime, with around 3.4 billion malicious emails sent daily. The rate of email-based phishing attacks rose by 464% in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year. Beyond outsiders, internal employees also unwittingly contribute to phishing attacks by clicking on spam emails, highlighting the critical need for robust IT network security controls and thorough employee training. Organizations can minimize the risks of falling prey to phishing attacks and other popular attack vectors used by hackers to infiltrate IT systems by implementing effective cybersecurity measures like IaaS (IT infrastructure as a service).
The Impact of Digital Transformation on CyberSecurity
The digital infrastructure era is responsible for more susceptible devices that consequently feed cyber criminals' attack scope, forcing the adoption of proactive cybersecurity to minimize risks. In banking and financial services, cybersecurity has to shift from defense against attacks to risk mitigation at an identity and endpoint level by being proactive regarding the giant digital footprints bringing equally large surface areas under attack.
Implementing a Comprehensive Security Strategy:
To tackle these challenges, senior executives can adopt a bespoke digital infrastructure and technology strategy roadmap that embeds security within IT assets without losing operational agility. Build strong defenses against cyber threats using AI-enabled IT network security tools like the identity-based Zero Trust network model, identity-based network access, and modern endpoint management as part of its efforts towards strengthening security measures and managing risks effectively. These solutions provide complete visibility into network activity and authorization configurations, allowing companies to proactively defend against an attack or respond quickly should there be a security incident. Real-time insights make complying with industry best practices and regulatory standards easier while lowering cyber threat risks among organizations safeguarding their data and digital infrastructure.
Partnering with IDC Technologies for Advanced Security Solutions
IDC Technologies leverages our expertise in Microsoft cloud tools and security solutions to offer tailored cybersecurity services to banking & financial service entities. By teaming up with IDC Technologies, businesses can fight off rising cyber-attack numbers, staying ahead in the IT network security arms race with good data governance and a proactive cyber security strategy.

Achieving Greater Agility - A Prospect for Banks With Cloud Adoption
The financial industry is undergoing a massive transition driven by several causes, including technological development, regulation modifications, and shifting customer expectations. This metamorphosis is compelling businesses to rethink their operational strategies and embrace innovative solutions to stay relevant. In this digital transformation era, cloud-hosted solutions are emerging as the cornerstone, offering unparalleled agility and scalability while reducing costs of hosting separate hardware platforms. Accordingly, 91% of bank executives agree that a cloud-first approach is essential to growth, indicating its inherent transformative power within the industry. The dynamics behind this strategy go beyond mere technological upgrades– it encompasses the total reimagining of banking practices required by the rapidly changing digital economy.
Understanding Cloud Architecture
Cloud architecture underlies this transformation and provides a flexible alternative to traditional on-site server infrastructure. The global cloud computing market in financial services stands at $ 26.93 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $ 80.30 Billion by 2029, expanding at an astounding CAGR of 20.05 % from 2024 to 2029.

Driving Change— Global Capability Centers (GCCs) at the Core of Business Transformation
Global Capability Centers (GCCs) accelerate technical innovation and advancement in today's fast-paced business environment. As companies expand internationally, the old rules for where they put their resources are breaking down, pushing GCCs as essential participants in the global business ecosystem. Initially conceived as offshore centers for large corporations, they have evolved into strategic partners driving business transformation and innovation.
Driving Factors Behind Global Capability Centers' Growth
Several factors are driving organizations towards GC Cs as a preferred outsourcing model:
Cost-effectiveness:Cost savings through lowered living costs and wages in the host countries enable GCCs to access highly skilled personnel at a lower price.
Innovation:>With skilled professionals and advanced technology infrastructure, GCCs are increasingly considered partners for innovation and digital transformation.
Geographical proximity:Being closer to their parent companies brings advantages such as improved local market accessibility, reduced cultural barriers, and better communication.
Government support:Several countries offer tax incentives and other infrastructure aid to set up GCCS. This reduces the cost of setting up and running these centers.
Business continuity:The COVID-19 pandemic has forced companies to adopt remote working models while continuing critical business functions. This has increased demand for GCCs since they offer uninterrupted operations during this crisis period.
Global Capability Centers In India:
A Hub of Innovation & Growth India is set to become a hub for GCCs, with nearly 2,000 such centers. At present, over 1500 GCCs are employing over 1.6 million professionals. These profit centers have been delivering key organization KPIs locally. According to NASSCOM's "India GCC Trends Half-Yearly Analysis Q2CY2023" report, there was an increase of 11.4% CAGR compared to 11% in the previous year for GCCs in India. The report also highlights that H1CY2023 established eighteen new GGC offices, nine each during Q1 CY 2023 and Q2 CY-23, respectively. Out of that, 44% are software and internet verticals, followed by equal distribution among BFSI, chemicals, and materials besides retail verticals at 11% each. Further, around 20% of the top Forbes 2000 already have their Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India. The figure is expected to rise significantly to 55% percent by the closing of 2030. This has also driven many more GCCs to start doing more tech work in-house rather than paying IT service providers.
GCCs: Pioneering Next-Gen Technology Trends
GCCs drive their parent organizations' competitiveness by adopting innovative technologies that create value for customers. Some of the cutting-edge technology trends in GCCs include:
Internet of Things (IoT):Through IoT platforms, GGC can track real-time information from connected devices, which increases operational efficiency while enhancing customer experience.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):GCCs leverage AI & ML to automate processes and make data-based decisions moving from customer service to manufacturing operations.
Cloud Computing:GCCs enable their parent organizations to adopt cloud computing, accessing advanced technologies like AI, ML, and IoT even as they scale down operations, reducing costs.
Virtual and Augmented Reality:GCCs use virtual and augmented reality to enrich customer experiences and employee training by facilitating immersive environments and simulating real-life situations.
Blockchain:Global Capability Centers uses blockchain technology to streamline processes across areas such as supply chain management or financial transactions, including protecting data against unauthorized access.
Conclusion
Global Capability Centers (GCCs) are poised to continue being critical drivers of global growth, providing necessary support services across industries. As enterprises expand internationally, GCCs will be at the forefront of accessing worldwide skills and promoting competitiveness and innovation. GCCs are crucial in scaling manufacturing innovations through data transparency and analytics that improve efficiency and profitability. Organizations that invest in GCCs will be better positioned to navigate the changing global business landscape, exploit rising opportunities, and maintain a competitive advantage.

Home Blog Healthcare Talent Management In The Digital Age

Healthcare Talent Management in the Digital Age
In the fast-paced world of healthcare, organizations face a challenging problem in talent acquisition and management. With rising resignations, labor strikes, and an ever-evolving landscape, healthcare providers are under immense pressure to attract, retain, and develop top talent. In the digital age, innovative solutions pave the way for transformative changes in how healthcare organizations approach talent management.
The Talent Conundrum
Healthcare organizations are grappling with multiple challenges due to a need for more talent. The industry is suffering from high employee turnover rates coupled with a scarcity of skilled professionals who can fill these positions. The 2023 NSI National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report reveals that the hospital turnover rate stands at 22.7%, significantly higher than that across all other sectors. While this is a 3.2% decrease from the previous year, ongoing issues such as labor shortages, employee burnout, and retirements have kept the turnover rates high.
One way to deal with this crisis is by personalizing talent acquisition and management strategies within healthcare facilities or systems. Just as healthcare providers tailor treatment plans to individual patients, organizations must customize the employee experience to meet their workforce's unique needs and preferences.
Personal Candidate Journeys
From expressing interest in an open position until after being hired into it or even beyond if necessary-– every stage involved during recruitment must be personalized towards candidates' expectations. This can be achieved through communication channel customization, giving them relevant information about what they want most, whether it's showcasing skills or demonstrating expertise, etc
AI-Driven Quality Hires Technology
Artificial intelligence has transformed the identification process used by hospitals looking for top-notch talents who fit well into their establishments' culture while having the desired qualifications for filling various roles within such institutions. Recruiters now use AI-driven tools to analyze large volumes of data sets to create lists of applicants suitable for specific positions based on certain required qualifications. This not only simplifies but also enhances quality hire outcomes realized by these organizations. According to research, 67% of recruiters using artificial intelligence agree on an increase in quality hiring.
Talent Marketplaces: Internal Opportunities
Healthcare systems need to focus more on nurturing the talents of their current workforce rather than just relying entirely upon external recruitment. This can be achieved through talent marketplaces where employees can explore different job openings within an organization. Organizations can improve talent acquisition retention, management, and engagement by providing employees with opportunities for growth and advancement.
Prioritizing Compliance
Compliance is a key requirement in healthcare, given its highly regulated nature. Organizations should ensure compliance is considered throughout the talent acquisition and management process. From recruitment and selection processes to induction or orientation programs and continuous training and development activities. By ensuring that all policies and procedures are followed, organizations can mitigate risk and maintain the trust of talent and stakeholders.
Boosting Engagement, Productivity, and Diversity
Personalized healthcare talent acquisition and management approach could significantly increase employee engagement levels. It can drive up productivity within various work units across different departments. Additionally, organizations can enhance diversity by considering people from diverse backgrounds to better reflect the communities they serve while tapping a wider range of skills needed for successful goal achievement.
Operational Efficiencies
Finally, healthcare organizations can leverage technology and data-driven insights to gain operational efficiencies throughout the talent management lifecycle. From reducing time-to-hire to improving workforce planning and scheduling, digital solutions can help organizations optimize resources and improve overall performance.
Closing Thoughts
To survive in the digital era, healthcare organizations must embrace innovation and adopt a personalized approach to talent acquisition and management to thrive in the digital age. By prioritizing the employee experience, leveraging AI-driven technology, and focusing on compliance and diversity, organizations can overcome their talent challenges and position themselves for long-term success.

Talent Sourcing Strategies for Fintech Companies: A Management Staffing Approach
The financial sector has had difficulties over the past few years resulting from supply chain interruptions, increased interest rates, global pandemic, inflation, etc. Despite all that, the industry has shown incredible resilience. The year 2022, for instance, saw one of the best progress– exhibiting a 14-year high robust sales and profitable growth. However, the BFSI industry may have to work harder to overcome rocky bumps this year. Grappling with APP fraud, high-profile bank failures, talent shortage, high employee turnover, and more— it has been a rough start for the banking and financial sectors, according to insights.
Current Challenges In the Banking Industry
A significant problem for the banking industry is the need for more skilled personnel. Nearly 9 out of 10 banks face difficulties in attracting or retaining staff despite the availability of talent from the "Great Resignation" wave experienced across Fintech and big-tech firms roughly two years ago.
Many candidates seek environments that offer more entrepreneurial opportunities or quick financial gains, which traditional banking struggles to provide. This necessitates a complete overhaul in how financial institutions source their talents. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts rapid expansion of business and financial occupations between 2021 and 2032, with around 911 400 new jobs expected to be created annually on average. However, the number considers the number of replacements for those leaving their roles, leading to a shortage.
Job security is another top concern for workers in the financial sector. In a survey of 35,000 respondents, around 52% expressed worries about job security due to economic uncertainty, while 37% were concerned about layoffs.
The Way Forward– Implementing Effective Targeted Talent Sourcing Strategy
Digital transformation has led to fierce competition for talent across all sectors. Employees with the right financial and digital skills are in high demand. Financial organizations must think outside the box regarding recruitment processes to attract and keep talent. This includes partnering with a management staffing agency specializing in sourcing top talents with the required skills and experience.
Maximizing Talent Acquisition in Fintech With Management Staffing Agency
Implementing an effective, targeted talent sourcing strategy with a management staffing agency can be crucial for securing top talent in this competitive industry.
Stay Updated With Latest Fintech Landscape:
Keep updated with Fintech trends such as central bank digital currencies, which are on the brink of widespread adoption, AI-powered personalized financial services, etc. In other words, you can tap into individuals with relevant knowledge about emerging technologies through a strategic management staffing approach, enabling your organization to adapt quickly and take advantage of new opportunities.
Tap into Niche Communities:
Interact with niche online communities, forums, or events related to Fintech to identify potential applicants. Management staffing agencies possess candidate trends, salary data, and market insights to identify suitable individuals. It's no wonder that 82% of companies believe data-driven recruiting improves the quality of hire.
Highlight Innovation and Impact:
A management staffing agency can elevate your organization's innovation and impact by effectively conveying its culture, values, and achievements. Research by Deloitte shows that 88% of millennials believe their organization's culture influences business success. With access to extensive talent networks, these agencies can connect you with candidates who resonate with your ethos. They also offer market insights and strategic branding expertise to position your organization as an innovation leader, enhancing its appeal to top talent.
Streamline Recruitment Processes:
The best recruitment processes are efficiency and transparency to provide a positive candidate experience. A survey found that 60% of job seekers have had a poor candidate experience, leading them to change their opinion about a role or company. Through a strategic management staffing approach, organizations can improve their recruitment processes. It encompasses utilizing technology and data analytics to automate routine tasks, provide timely feedback to applicants, and maintain clear communication throughout the talent acquisition.
Conclusion
In summary, recruiting new talent in the fintech sector is highly dynamic. Organizations that embrace change and diversity and steer their strategies to align with the fluctuating demands of the job market will be counted among employers of choice. Such organizations will attract top talents and build a platform for long-term growth and innovation in this vast world of the BFSI industry. Contact us today to learn more about how IDC Technologies can help your organization attract and retain top talent.

Unlocking Healthcare Success: The Strategic Impact of IT Staff Augmentation
Staff augmentation is akin to assembling your dream team without the headache. It's having a strategic partner that's both flexible and innovative. According to Statista projections, the worldwide outsourcing market is anticipated to reach a value of US$777.70 billion by 2028. The growth of this market is expected to be significantly influenced by the healthcare sector, solidifying staff augmentation as a crucial strategy for industry success.
Boosting Healthcare Teams: The Power of IT Staff Augmentation
Building an in-house team can be time-consuming, and the team needs backup. That's where consulting companies that offer IT staffing solutions come in valuable. They provide a roster of thoroughly vetted professionals, each boasting extensive experience in the field of medicine & healthcare.
When healthcare projects face sudden workload surges, implementation hurdles, or a complex project screaming for specific skills, staff augmentation services is the solution. According to Deloitte, 57% of businesses choose staff augmentation for flexibility and speed. These aren't just your run-of-the-mill 'temps' or 'interns'— they are certified professionals who've made a career out of being the innovators of augmentation.
Below are some powerful ways staff augmentation impacts the healthcare industry.
Organizational Growth and Knowledge Transfer: Knowledge transfer fuels organizational growth. 79% of CEOs worry about critical skill availability, while 49% advocate for complete automation or AI replacement of "most" or "all" aspects of their roles. IT staff augmentation services through a good healthcare workforce service provider fill skill gaps and transfer invaluable knowledge through its expertise & experience , propelling your organization forward.
Increased Flexibility & Scalability:The ability to adapt is a powerful leverage. Studies show flexible workforce models can bump profits by up to 59%. It equates to a strategic capability that lets you effortlessly expand or contract your team's size as needed.
Maintaining Quality while Reducing Costs:Staff augmentation is a formidable money-saving strategy. Companies can slash costs with minimal headcount reduction over revamping the entire team. This allows for substantially redirecting funds towards critical areas such as research and advanced technologies.
Boosted Team Endurance:Staff augmentation isn't just about plugging gaps but also about preventing burnout. Harvard Business Review says job burnout costs an estimated $125 billion to $190 billion yearly in healthcare. Bringing in resource augmentation services during workload peaks gives your existing team a breather, improves job satisfaction, and saves your organization from burnout-related costs.
In the healthcare world, staff augmentation isn't just a solution. It embodies the crucial professional team you may have yet to recognize as indispensable. With great power comes great responsibility— the responsibility to choose the right IT staff augmentation services and unleash the full potential of your healthcare organization.

This revolutionary technology is reshaping how organizations attract and manage talent. GenAI, a cutting-edge subset of artificial intelligence, is gaining momentum across various industries, with human resources at the forefront of this technological wave.
The Influence of Generative AI on Talent Management
The impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on talent acquisition and management is set for a game-changing boost. Predictions indicate a substantial USD 1,847.58 billion investment by the AI industry across all sectors by 2030, reflecting a remarkable CAGR of 32.9% by 2030.

As organizations eagerly embrace this technological leap, GenAI is poised to redefine how talent is managed, promising innovation and efficiency in the years ahead.
GenAI Use Cases in Talent Acquisition and Management
As the recruitment industry embraces the digital era, GenAI trends emerge as a pivotal tool, transforming hiring processes in various ways.
Automated Pre-Screening with GenAI
GenAI revolutionizes the traditionally time-consuming pre-screening process by swiftly and accurately evaluating candidate qualifications (estimates show a reduction of an average of 40% of working time). AI-driven questions tailored to job prerequisites accelerate the screening process and enhance recruiter productivity and engagement.
Generating Engaging Job Descriptions
Crafting compelling job descriptions is critical, and GenAI simplifies this by analyzing trends, culture, and skill sets to generate postings that resonate with candidates. A survey also shows content generated by GenAI resulted in a 40% increase in applicant engagement. This indicates a more effective recruitment marketing that attracts a broader pool of applicants.
Enhancing Communication & Summarizing Candidate Feedback
GenAI suggests personalized responses to common candidate queries, improving communication efficiency. Study shows how GenAI-driven responses lead to a 25% reduction in response time, fostering better candidate relationships. Recruiters can focus on building meaningful relationships, a critical factor in successful talent acquisition. Meanwhile, GenAI also efficiently summarizes candidate feedback. It offers valuable insights into refining recruitment processes. Analyzing feedback at scale helps identify strengths and areas for improvement, enhancing candidate satisfaction and employer branding.
Real-Time Job Recommendations & Standardized Resumes
GenAI analyzes candidates' backgrounds in a competitive job market to provide real-time job recommendations, create a positive experience, and contribute to a strong employer brand. GenAI also makes standardized resumes, saving candidates time, ensuring fair comparisons, and reduced biases, promoting a more equitable recruitment process.
The Impact of GenAI on Recruitment Strategies
GenAI tools have evolved traditional hiring strategies, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and personalization. It accelerates candidate selection by rapidly analyzing vast data, ensuring comprehensive and objective evaluations, and reducing human error and bias. Typically, businesses can speed up their hiring process by around 30%, and cut down the expense per hire by 35% while boosting the number of qualified applications by a substantial 55%.
GenAI pulls essential skills for compelling job descriptions and enables personalized interactions with candidates, significantly improving the candidate experience at scale. A study shows that even a 5% increase in interactions through GenAI can contribute to a 25% to 95% profit growth. According to McKinsey, companies investing in GenAI experience a revenue boost ranging from 3-15%. The GenAI approach facilitates a shift from credential-based to skill-based recruitment, which puts the focus on actual skills and experiences that broaden the talent pool and promote inclusivity.
Conclusion

Integrating GenAI into talent acquisition and management processes presents unparalleled advantages, accompanied by ethical considerations. Striking the right balance between technological efficiency and human insight is paramount. Understanding its capabilities and limitations is crucial to fully harnessing GenAI's potential for improved talent management outcomes. This necessitates a commitment to continuous learning and a proactive approach to candidate sourcing, which plays a central role in shaping the innovative and inclusive talent management practices that GenAI can facilitate.

Digital Transformation and Cloud Adoption: A Symbiotic Relationship
If you were to peek into what's happening in the tech world, you’ll notice businesses are always racing to transform digitally and stay ahead of the game. The tight bond between going digital and adopting the cloud is at the heart of this transformation. Cloud computing and virtualization technology are reshaping how organizations do their things.
The Rise Of Computing And Virtualization Technology
Over the past decade, cloud adoption has been off the charts, completely flipping the script on how businesses handle their data, infrastructure, and applications. According to the latest insight from Gartner, Inc., spending on public cloud services is gearing up for an impressive $678.8 billion in 2024, up from $563.6 billion in 2023. It's a substantial 20.4% leap from the previous year, indicating the massive expansion of cloud services on a global scale.
Businesses are collectively waking up to the power of cloud technologies, and the numbers tell a tale of a significant shift in the tech landscape. This surge in cloud adoption is a strategic move, a big chess move, if you will, toward becoming more agile, scalable, and cost-efficient in an industry dominated by volatile trends.
The Buzz on Cloud and Digital Transformation:
Digital transformation is a holistic change for organizations. Beyond technological upgrades, it's about injecting digital mojo into every operation. And guess what? Cloud computing and virtualization technology is an intrinsic component of this process. Like a backbone, it acts as the solid foundation, enabling smooth integration, fostering innovation, and providing scalability.
The Cloud - Fueling the Innovation Engine
The cloud turbocharges digital transformation by being a hotbed for innovation. It's an ingenious area free from the constraints of conventional on-premise systems, allowing companies to test out new concepts and technology freely. This flexibility is essential in fields where keeping up with the latest innovations is essential to surpassing competitors. A notable example is the healthcare sector, where cloud-based solutions push the boundaries with telemedicine, predictive analytics, and personalized medicine. A survey revealed about 70% of IT folks in healthcare are already on the cloud train. In the following two years, 20% more people are prepared to join. The adoption rate will have reached an astounding 90% by 2025. Why? The cloud offers a ticket to flexibility and scalability, the things needed to push the innovation envelope. However, it's not just healthcare hogging the limelight— every industry gets a front-row seat.
Cloud computing and virtualization technology are the great equalizers, offering startups and big names the tools and resources to turn bright ideas into reality. This democratization of innovation is why you see breakthroughs not just in Silicon Valley but everywhere.
Scalability for the Win
Cloud adoption is essential to achieving scalability, which is the capacity to expand without exerting excessive effort. Consider the case of Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's not just a cloud giant— it's the go-to for big players like Airbnb. When there's a surge during peak times, AWS lets Airbnb scale up its game, ensuring a smooth experience for users. Other e-commerce platforms are leveraging the same advantage to grow. Reports show retail e-commerce sales hit nearly 5.7 trillion US dollars globally in 2022. Projections suggest a significant growth of 56%, with the total expected to reach around 8.1 trillion dollars by 2026.
Boosting Agility in an Ever-Changing Setting
Agility is a defining characteristic of successful businesses in the digital era. The cloud is like the choreographer, ensuring companies can spin, twirl, and pivot without missing a beat. Cloud and digital transformation gives organizations the agility to promptly address market changes, meet customer demands, and seize emerging opportunities. This is particularly noticeable in software development, where cloud-centric DevOps practices have become the standard. And better yet, it's not just the techies. Even manufacturing giants are taking a page from the cloud playbook— around 79% of businesses in Asia (home to the world's largest manufacturers) use technology to increase their last-mile efficiency.
Cost Efficiency and Resource Optimization
Saving money is a big deal for businesses considering hopping on cloud computing and virtualization technology. The old-school on-premise setup can demand hefty upfront investments and keep hitting you with ongoing maintenance costs. But with cloud services, it's a pay-as-you-go deal – you only fork out cash for the resources you use. It's a smart financial move.
Take Netflix, the binge-watching champion. By shifting its infrastructure to the cloud, Netflix skipped the big bucks on hardware and got the ability to scale globally. It's like upgrading from a local theater to a blockbuster premiere. The cloud didn't just save Netflix money— it fueled its rapid expansion.
And we can't forget about resource optimization – ensuring every tech tool is working its socks off. Like a wise manager, cloud adoption ensures that computing power, storage, and other resources perform efficiently.
Navigating the Cloudy Challenges
Although there are many advantages to the mutually beneficial relationship between cloud adoption and digital transformation, there are drawbacks. The main concern is security. However, a survey shows that 57% of organizations trust public cloud providers with their sensitive data. This trust is based on cloud service providers' significant investments in security-related infrastructure and knowledge. The rulebook that everyone must abide by is regulatory compliance, particularly in sectors like finance and healthcare. Cloud providers are the referee, ensuring everyone plays by the rules. They strive to meet industry-specific standards, but organizations must do their homework to stay on the right side of the law.
While cloud and digital transformation is the right move, it may only be practical for some, especially for established enterprises with legacy systems. According to Gartner, 75% of big-shot enterprises will use a mix of on-premise and cloud solutions by 2026. This hybrid approach allows organizations to balance leveraging the benefits of the cloud and maintaining critical on-premise infrastructure.
IDC Technologies: Redefining Digital Waves
IDC Technologies has a deep knowledge and a commitment to staying on the cutting edge, helping businesses gain the strategic insights they need to navigate the complex world of modern technology. Their expertise goes beyond the norm, assisting clients to tap into the full power of cloud computing and virtualization technology and gain a competitive edge.

They're the backstage pass to making tech work for you— turning challenges into opportunities and setting the stage for unparalleled success. If you're intrigued to explore your cloud and digital transformation journey, IDC Technologies' services offer a pathway for personalized guidance.
Conclusion
As businesses adopt cloud computing and virtualization technology, the friendship between digital transformation and cloud adoption will remain a driving force behind technological advancements. The statistics and examples cited in this exploration underscore the transformative impact of cloud adoption on diverse industries. They demonstrate how software, manufacturing, healthcare, and e-commerce companies now rely on the cloud as their primary resource—an essential tool for businesses looking to prosper in the digital era.
To wrap it up, this symbiotic synergy points to a future where things just click. Cloud and digital transformation propel companies to the front in a time marked by being inventive, quick on their feet, and super-efficient. The journey to a digital future is like a blockbuster – dynamic, ever-changing, and full of surprises. And businesses? Well, they better be ready for the sequel!

Increase in adaptable workforce: Americans are becoming more interested in temporary, contract, or gig-based employment. This tendency is consistent with the priorities of staffing companies and creates an environment that is conducive to the expansion of the industry.
Revamping the Employee Experience: A notable trend in talent acquisition and management is the reinvention of the employee experience. Businesses that put a high priority on employee engagement stand to gain 1% more revenue for every 2% increase in employee satisfaction. Navigating the challenge of keeping remote workers connected and engaged has become paramount. Therefore, recruiters will play a pivotal role in reshaping and adapting the employee experience to the dynamics of the new remote work environment.
Ensuring the Well-being of the Recruitment Team: The focus on health and well-being emerges as a lasting legacy of the pandemic, making 2023 a pivotal year for implementing and evaluating mental health policies. In 2024, a surge in employee well-being apps, surveys, and training is expected to take centre stage, solidifying its status as a key trend in recruitment.
Transition To Remote Work: In the wake of the widespread transition to remote work, the structure of the staffing workforce in the United States has undergone a significant shift. The conventional approach of selecting candidates based on their geographical location has been overshadowed by the surge in remote work opportunities. This transformation has positioned the staffing industry uniquely, allowing it to overcome traditional barriers and source talent more competitively than other sectors.
Prioritizing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) will continue to be a focal point in 2024. As per the World Bank, embracing workplace gender equality emerges as a value capable of contributing up to £120 trillion to the global economy. Additionally, companies boasting the most ethnically and culturally diverse boards on a global scale are found to be 43% more likely to achieve elevated profits.
The Rise of Data-Driven Recruitment Strategy: Data drive strategy is among the latest recruitment trends and will continue to take the spotlight in the coming year. The influx of information and data, driven by remote work and ongoing changes induced by the pandemic, requires managers to possess a comprehensive understanding of data, budgets, and other crucial information. This adeptness ensures that every recruitment strategy is meticulously aligned with vital data and reports for a successful bottom line.
Leveraging Technological Progress: Candidates and clients are finding augmented staffing platforms appealing. A platform-centric approach has proven successful in the industrial and nursing staffing domains.
IDC Technologies: Shaping the Future of US Staffing
A pivotal player in this evolving staffing landscape is IDC Technologies, whose impact on the industry has been nothing short of transformative. By prioritizing strategic workforce solutions, quality, and client satisfaction, IDC Technologies has set new standards for the entire staffing sector. Beyond mere service delivery, the company has introduced progressive workforce management strategies and innovative hiring practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. In doing so, IDC Technologies has not only become a reliable collaborator but also a catalyst for industry development, actively shaping the trajectory of US staffing. As the industry grapples with the challenges and opportunities presented by remote work, IDC Technologies stands at the forefront, reshaping and redefining the way talent acquisition and management is approached and executed in the modern era.
Conclusion
After a little hiccup that followed a period of robust expansion, it looks like the US staffing industry is positioning itself for long-term stability. The workforce is changing, and is set to drive the staffing industry toward renewed growth in the coming year. If staffing companies have their funding game strong, they're in a great spot to not just keep the profits growing but also to jump on exciting new business opportunities. Take into account the trends listed above, then give your recruitment strategy and tech tools a thorough once-over to ensure you're making stellar hires in 2024.

What Is Customer Service And Why Outsourcing Is The Answer?
Customer service is the act of supporting a customer, where interactions happen between a company representative and a client who has purchased its product or service. Customer service representatives serve to improve the experience of the customer with the company. Whether it is answering their queries or troubleshooting problems, customer service teams and BPO service providers aim to nurture lasting customer relations with the company.
Remember that good customer service is vital for most customers to feel loyalty towards a brand. Moreover, customers are also likely to repeat purchases after a good experience with a company. However, after just one bad experience, studies show that half of the business’s customers will switch to a competitive brand. This number could quickly escalate in case of multiple bad experiences, thus derailing a business. Customers are a major stakeholder of your company, and such is their power today!
Now that you know its importance, what is good customer service? While the presence of automation and chatbots has become crucial for a quicker service, the presence of a human element such as a good customer representative will never go out of value for a business! And this is where BPO agencies and outsourcing firms can be invaluable players to further your business, especially if you don't have the resources to own an in-house customer service team. Read ahead as we list why outsourcing your customer service to such agencies is the answer to building better customer-brand relationships.
Benefits of Outsourcing Customer Service
Outsourcing your customer service gets you in touch with expert professionals who have the experience and immense expertise to deal with customers. Moreover, these customer representatives are good at communication skills, pay attention to the smallest details and are passionate about helping people in need.
 One of the biggest advantages of outsourcing your customer service are the reduced costs. An outsourced team of professionals costs far lesser than hiring the same number of customer service employees and providing them with additional benefits.
The reduced costs also ensure a huge competitive advantage for small and medium sized businesses that may not be able to sustain a large in-house customer service team. Outsourcing then places them at par with large corporations in the business world today!
As the entire world is more accessible to us due to technology, businesses today deal with customers all over the globe. In such cases, achieving an efficient round the clock customer service may get quite challenging for certain businesses. To meet this need, reputed BPO service providers in India provide 24x7 customer support in different geographical time zones.
Outsourcing your customer services also is an incredible help if a company uses multiple communication channels to interact with customers. Talking with tons of customers over the phone, voice calls, live chat messages, emails, social media DMs, and messages gets easier with an efficient system set up as per your particular business model.
Sometimes, businesses may face a seasonal spike during certain periods of the year. These sales contribute a major portion to their annual business turnover! To sustain the same level of excellent customer service during this time, such companies often partner with outsourcing agencies to have more hands on deck who can efficiently handle all orders and queries.
At IDC technologies too, we study your business well and devise a customer service strategy based on your needs. We then execute it with the help of our professional customer service teams who offer round the clock service and lightening quick response times! These traits set us apart from the rest of the outsourcing agencies in India.

5 Sure Signs You Need A Debt Collection Agency
A difficult part about being a small or medium-sized business owner is when you see a number of your clients not paying their bills. At this stage in your business - you have little time on your hands to go chasing after your customers for every unpaid invoice. In fact, as these debts get old, it becomes even more difficult to collect them from your client!
This is why hiring a professional debt collection service may be in your best interest today as they can recover your deserving dues quickly and efficiently, without you having to compromise your valuable time and energy. Here are five signs that tell you it may be time to contact a debt collection agency. 
1. Overdue Receivables Are Impacting Your Cash Flow
One of the most obvious signs that you may need the help of a debt collection agency, is when the overdue bills you need to collect keep mounting. In fact, they now impact the cash flow of your business, where you are incurring regular losses. This is why it’s advisable to not wait too long, otherwise, you may reach a point where you will be unable to pay your own bills!
2. Collecting Bills Take Up Your Precious Business Time
For any business, time is of the utmost importance. The minute collecting debts from your customers interferes with your time that is used to do core business tasks, it may be time to hire a collection agency. These services will collect these debts professionally for you, saving up your immense time and energy in the process!
3. You Don’t Have Dedicated Staff to Handle Collections
One bad debt collection strategy that many businesses may invariably opt for is asking their accounting bookkeepers or even sales professionals to collect overdue bills from their customers. This burdens their workload, harms morale, and there is a chance you may lose good employees! As for sales reps, their role is to nurture good relationships with the company customers. Sending them back to collect your debts may hamper client relations and thus your business.
Instead, it's always better to employ a good debt collector to recover your bills. This is because they know the nuances of debt recovery laws, deal with customers professionally, and yet maintain good relations with them. Your debtors too, are bound to take them more seriously and will quickly pay up for fear of getting sued instead.  
4. Accounts Show Unpaid Invoices That Are Older Than 60 Days
If you see a frequent number of accounts where payments are not being made even after 30 to 60 days, it’s the right time to contact a collection agency. After 60 days, these accounts are considered ‘delinquent’. This is when you tie up with a  debt collection service that will work on recovering these funds from your debtors on your behalf. If you wait longer than this, you may incur more difficulty in collecting your debts. 
5. One Of Your Debtors May Be Going Bankrupt
Look for telltale signs such as repetitive bouncing checks or no response at all to your frequent attempts at communication by the client. Chances are that your debtor's business may be running out of money, and your instincts tell you that the debt may get written off if you don't act on time. So, don't wait too long and hire a collection agency to do your work.
While these signs suggest that you are in need of debt collection, you must also ensure to do some research and hire the best one out there. These agencies should also possess licensing certificates, error insurance policies, and have significant knowledge of legal ways to recover debts. At IDC Technologies too, we specialize in getting you in touch with such top-grade debt collection services who will collect your dues quickly and efficiently, all the while maintaining good relations with your clients.

Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing An IT Staffing Firm
With the IT world evolving quickly, it's no secret that businesses today require the excellent expertise of IT staffing and recruiting companies. In an industry such as this, finding and hiring the right candidates can get pretty overwhelming for a business. To save your precious time and energy, such staffing agencies come to your rescue as they quickly get you in touch with top IT talent. However, it is also quite crucial to know which agency will be the perfect fit for your business requirements. So read ahead as we tell you about 5 mistakes a company should avoid while hiring an IT staffing agency.
Mistake 1 - Relying Solely on The Agency’s Work Experience
While staffing agencies that possess the experience of 10 plus years are a great choice, one must also look for other things they bring to your business. Rather than only hiring the agency by taking its experience at face value, have a look at how well it has adapted itself to the rapidly changing IT technology over the years.
In this aspect, IDC technologies can be a great IT staffing partner for businesses! This is because we not only bring a robust experience of 13 years to your business, but also use updated systems that are at par with the leading IT trends of today. Besides our long experience and expertise, we also boast of high success in the form of 100% client retention!
Mistake 2 - Only Focusing on Your Technical Needs
Professional staffing agencies know that bringing only technical systems to the corporate table is not enough! To find the right candidate who is a perfect fit, there are several factors the agency needs to know about your business involving your work ethics, company culture, business processes, HR policies, position KPIs etc.
Such knowledge about your business will help the agency screen better candidates for you. In this way, you will know that your capital is being used for the right recruitment efforts. Hence, you must hire a staffing agency that wants to know all about your business instead of choosing one that is only interested in fulfilling only your IT needs.
Mistake 3 - Getting Lured By The Promise of Hiring Employees Who Work for Lower Pay
Many staffing agencies may promise to find you top talent in the IT industry who will work for lower than average pay. Remember that even if you land such a deal, the employee may leave your company at the first chance they get for a better offer somewhere else.
Thus, you will not only lose out on the best members of your workforce but will also end up increasing your employee turnover costs. A reputed IT staffing company, on the other hand, will offer your candidates a competitive salary as per their required pay scale to prevent them from jumping ship in the longer run.
Mistake 4 - Setting The Bar Too Low for Communication
Be it conveying its recruiting strategies to you or being responsive to your emails - a professional staffing agency will always be transparent and clear in its communication process. Look for such an agency that prioritizes your calls and queries, has a quicker turnaround time and gives timely feedback throughout the hiring process. At IDC Technologies too, we value your time well and our staffing service provides you with top candidate resumes within a mere 24 hours!
Mistake 5 - Partnering with a cultural misfit
Just as you wouldn't risk hiring a candidate that is a cultural misfit, the same rule goes for partnering with such an IT staffing agency. An agency that does not set much stock by your business ethics and values will derail the partnership quickly.
As a business owner, if your company values are based on transparency, timeliness, quality work and trust, then you must choose a consultancy that functions by the same values. This will develop a good bond between your business and the agency, where communication, trust and work ethics match to create one cohesive working team.
As an IT staffing and recruiting company that has been in this industry for more than a decade now, we too, function with certain such values everyday. Our core values encapsulate integrity, responsibility, reliability, and result driven work ethics. We have stood by these ethics in our service to each business that partners with us, which is why our clients continue to partner with us today!

Home Blog The Future Of E-commerce – Companies Can Create The Exceptional With BPO Outsourcing

The Future of E-commerce – Companies can create the exceptional with BPO Outsourcing
E-commerce has made shopping easy for customers. The future of e-commerce in India is bright. The ever-increasing internet penetration and smartphones have added impetus to the growth of e-commerce. According to IBEF, the Indian e-commerce sector is expected to touch USD 99 billion by 2024. The e-commerce industry is quick to adapt to new technologies.
The ecommerce world is becoming increasingly competitive. If you want your business to stay ahead of the competition, it is vital to monitor e-commerce trends constantly. No matter how good your e-commerce store is doing business right now, if you don’t keep up with e-commerce trends, it can drastically affect your business. It would be best if you keep looking ahead to ensure future success.
Here are some major trends that are shaping the future of e-commerce in India
Omnichannel Shopping
A majority of customers do online research before visiting an e-commerce store. It is important that businesses fully integrate all their channels to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience.
Omnichannel shopping is when a brand fully integrates all its channels, both digital and brick and mortar. When done right, omnichannel strategies are useful to drive revenue. In fact, according to research by Google they can help generate 80% of a business’s in-store visits.
Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality (AI and AR)
As things like AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants and personalised shopping experiences are becoming the new norm, businesses should ensure to utilise new AI and AR technologies, so they are not left behind. All these applications are helpful in providing an easier, more enjoyable shopping experience to consumers.
New payment options
Payment is an important part of any business process. That is why it is crucial to provide customers a variety of payment options by accepting things like digital wallets, mobile payments, and cryptocurrency. Providing several payment options can reduce cart abandonment and ultimately drive revenue.
Rise of Visual Commerce
In an era of information overload, grabbing a customer’s attention can be difficult for brands. This is why visual communication is more important than ever. E-commerce businesses should utilise visual tactics like high-quality photography, video and AR to keep customers engaged.
Data- Driven Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing is a strategy when businesses adjust pricing to reflect consumer demand. This is not a new concept, but new technology and AI can help in making pricing more accurate and accessible. Popular companies like Amazon have already implemented technology to optimise its pricing strategies and other businesses who follow this suit are seeing a boost in earnings.
Integrating the services of BPO outsourcing companies like IDC Technologies can be a perfect starting point to boost your e-commerce services.
With a successful track record of 18 years, IDC technologies have emerged as the preferred customer service outsourcing company for many firms in India and overseas.
Our skilled teams of professionals with a commitment to support your business processes can take customer experience to the next level. IDC Technologies can help your company create and sustain meaningful customer relationships, improving your brand's position while allowing you to focus on the core activities that strengthen your operations.

5 reasons why Payroll Outsourcing Can Be A Boon for Startups & SMEs
1. Saves Time and Enhances Productivity
Time management is one of the most crucial aspects of growing a business, especially for startups and SMEs. And in-house payroll processing often tends to consume a lot of time for the business. Keeping accurate track and maintaining a large amount of data that includes paid time offs, new hires, bonus benefits, and tax change requirements can get quite tedious! As staff numbers grow - this process only keeps getting more cumbersome.
A payroll processing firm, on the other hand, will take all these tasks off your hands and get done with them in half the time to boot! In this way, your employees are instead completely focused on the core business tasks to help generate more revenue.
For example - Besides salary processing, IDC Technologies manage reimbursements, do income tax computations, handle statutory compliances, and even install an issue resolving cell. Our firm's team of experts can quickly provide a range of services to help you save precious time and enhance the productivity of your business.
2. Cost Effective
While large corporations often have in-house payroll departments, it can get quite expensive for startups and growing businesses to maintain the costs of hiring a team of full-time accounting professionals as well as give them additional benefits! This is where payroll outsourcing can be quite a boon as they require to be paid only for the services provided to the business.
Moreover, such outsourcing firms also do the job of an entire payroll team! They also find cost-effective solutions in your payroll system and help you avoid government penalties. In the long run - it proves to be a super cost-effective system!
3. Gives Higher Accuracy
Because such outsourcing firms invest in top-notch technology - they can provide quick HR and payroll management solutions to businesses. Access to technology such as robotic process automation (RPA) as well as cloud-based servers bring in the high accuracy and better transparency that is required for payroll processes.
In fact - some agencies also tend to integrate payroll systems with HR so that the information that gets updated by them is easily accessible for payroll management. Moreover - it’s even better if IT staffing and recruiting companies (such as IDC Technologies) offer payroll outsourcing, as it leads to even more integration with the HR management system to streamline the payroll process.
4. Ensures Compliance with Current Laws
A lot of growing businesses often tend to struggle when handling payroll policies as per the required government regulations. Complex laws, ever-changing tax regulations, PF percentages, and employee benefit errors can often become audit issues for the company that may lead to hefty penalties.
In this aspect - payroll services always keep updated with the right information and have the perfect expertise to make your entire payroll system compliant with the current laws of the government.
5. Improves Data Security
While many are of the opinion that data may be less secure outside the company - this is quite a myth! In fact - there are a lot of risks also associated with in-house payroll, such as server unsafety, identity theft and embezzlement.
Reputed payroll outsourcing firms on the other hand, have secure safety policies in place to ensure that your company's critical data is safe. They often save your data on secure cloud-based servers and have the top encryption technology in place!
At IDC Technologies too, such confidential data is given the top network security and at times a virtual domain network is also created for payroll processing. In fact, record-keeping too, is done in an isolated area to ensure further physical security. With our varied efforts - we ensure that your data is in safe hands as well as all payroll functions are done efficiently.

Home Blog What Is Cloud Migration? Strategy, Processes & Benefits

What is Cloud Migration? Strategy, Processes & Benefits
Cloud migration is the process of moving business operations like data, applications, and other IT resources from a private server or local on-premises data center to the cloud computing environment that can be accessed anytime from anywhere. 
Today, businesses are migrating to a cloud computing environment to improve their operational performance, agility, scalability, security, and user experience. Nearly 6 out of 10 businesses are moving their work to the cloud, and this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. At IDC Technologies, we are helping businesses make a transformative shift to the cloud.
Common Cloud Migration Strategies
There are five cloud migration strategies commonly known as 5Rs. Companies that want to migrate to the cloud should consider which migration strategy can fit their needs.
Rehosting
Rehosting is a strategy to shift an application from an on-premises host to a cloud service. In this situation, no big architectural change needs to be done to the servers and applications. They are simply taken from on-premises (the lift) and then moved to the cloud (the shift).Rehosting is suitable for companies that want to run quickly to the cloud without making extensive changes.
Replatforming
Replatforming is a migration strategy that is a variation of the rehosting approach and aims to optimize workloads and applications before moving them to the cloud.Replatforming allows companies to upversion applications while retaining the core application architecture. Upversioning involves rewriting application codes to make necessary changes to optimize its usage in the cloud.
Refactoring
Refactoring is a strategic approach requiring extensive changes to the legacy application architecture and a large portion of its codebase for an optimum fit into the cloud environment.Refactoring aims to enhance the existing application and implement features that are difficult to achieve with the current way the application is structured.
Repurchasing
Repurchasing involves moving from on-premises to a cloud setup by scrapping existing licenses and starting up with newer ones to fit the cloud model. It is commonly used for adopting a SaaS-based version of an application that provides the same features, though it works in a cloud-based subscription model.
Retiring
Retiring is astrategic approach that involves turning off parts of an organizational IT portfolio that are no longer useful or important to the business requirements.
Benefits of Cloud Migration
Moving to the cloud allows businesses to expand and grow effortlessly while working within the existing infrastructure.
Scalability
Cloud migration can scale to support larger workloads and more users much more quickly and efficiently than on-premises infrastructure.
Cost
Cloud providers offer managed IT services that lower your operational costs and streamline maintenance tasks such as upgrades. Companies that migrate to the cloud spend significantly less on maintaining IT operations. They dedicate more resources to innovations like developing new products or improving existing products.
Performance
Migrating to the cloud improves performance and enhances the end-user experience. Websites and Applications hosted in the cloud can easily scale to serve more users and can run in geographical locations near end-users to reduce network latency.
Digital experience
Migrating to the cloud allows users to easily access cloud services and data from anywhere, whether employees or customers. This not only contributes to digital transformation, but enables an improved experience for customers, and provides employees with modern, flexible tools.
Why Choose the right cloud environment?
Identifying the right cloud environment that is suitable for your applications and IT infrastructure can help you achieve your business goals. Not all applications are cloud friendly. Some applications perform better on a private or hybrid cloud, while some need minor modifications.
There are three types of cloud services- public, private and hybrid. Every type of cloud environment has its own benefits and risks, and each one of them might be suitable depending on the criteria including organization’s size, type of data to be stored, and other business needs.
Analysing your architecture and carefully checking all your applications can help determine which application is suitable to migrate. Analysing your architecture and carefully checking all your applications can help determine which application is appropriate to migrate.
Moving your business operations to the cloud offers numerous benefits if properly executed. With the right expert by your side, like IDC Technologies, you get assistance to prepare all the resources and required assessments to make your cloud migration process successful.

The Big Data Talent Shortage: Ask Four Important Questions
Skills shortages are the perennial challenge faced by many CIOs, particularly when it comes to developing big leading-edge data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Not having enough skilled data scientists prevents companies from keeping up with the pace of change. This is having a severe impact on their business.
Skills shortages present a real problem, and it is essential to accelerate mechanisms to address them. Organizations must consider asking themselves four important questions to solve the big data talent shortage.
What is causing big data talent problem?
As businesses are integrating new-age technologies and solutions, they are leveraging the value of big data to make wise business decisions. The increasing demand for data analytics in the companies has given rise to an exponential shortage of data scientists. Although many individuals pursue data science as a career, there isn’t enough skilled labour to fill the jobs. The number of STEM graduates (science, technology, engineering and math) each year isn’t in sync with the requirement of data scientists in the industry.
Analyse the recruitment efforts and process of your company. How do your company’s recruiting efforts and culture look to a potential employee? While looking for a new job, 69% of IT professionals say they seek a new job to advance their IT skills. Does the opening of a big data role in your company offer better career growth? Is there an attractive environment for work-life balance, and what are substantial benefits for employees? Tackling the big data talent shortage begins with ensuring your organization is not waiving any red flags to jobseekers.
How to secure big data?
Data Collection and analysis can help a business predict consumer behaviour, improve decision-making, know market trends, and determine the ROI of its marketing efforts. Working with sensitive data, especially when the consumer information is involved, requires additional security programs, measures, and human resources.
51% of executives mention security concerns as the biggest obstacle preventing them from implementing a big data strategy. Data collection is vital for your business, but it is also important to safeguard that information. Even if you can hire a brilliant data expert, are you prepared to take necessary security measures to protect that sensitive information.
How to use big data?
Having realistic expectations about the capabilities of your data is a necessary step in solving the talent problem. How is your industry using the data it collects? What insights are your competitors gaining from their data analysis? Being unsure does not put much confidence into any data analyst candidate you interview and can cast your business in a negative light.
The shortage of data professionals is not just a problem in the tech industry. Organizations like banking & finance, communications, media & entertainment, healthcare & medicine, and transportation require data experts, thus, increasing the talent shortage. Therefore, companies that want to hire data talent should clarify what goals the person is being hired to meet and the availability of resources that can help to achieve those goals.
Should I Ask for Help?
Finding and hiring people with big data and analytics skills is not an easy task. That’s where outsourcing to the right IT staffing company can help you. Having an expert who takes responsibility for finding the right talent for your organisation not only eases your burden but also allows you to focus on your core business. Moreover, it will help to drastically cut down the time it takes to implement new data strategies.
What can IDC Technologies do for you?
IDC Technologies has worked effectively with many reputed companies to solve their talent shortage problems and helped them hire big data and analytics professionals. With our staffing solutions, you can find the right talent aligned with your organisation’s business goals and work culture.

Omnichannel shopping is when a brand fully integrates all its channels, both digital and brick and mortar. When done right, omnichannel strategies are useful to drive revenue. In fact, according to research by Google they can help generate 80% of a business’s in-store visits.
Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality (AI and AR)
As things like AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants and personalised shopping experiences are becoming the new norm, businesses should ensure to utilise new AI and AR technologies, so they are not left behind. All these applications are helpful in providing an easier, more enjoyable shopping experience to consumers.
New payment options
Payment is an important part of any business process. That is why it is crucial to provide customers a variety of payment options by accepting things like digital wallets, mobile payments, and cryptocurrency. Providing several payment options can reduce cart abandonment and ultimately drive revenue.
Rise of Visual Commerce
In an era of information overload, grabbing a customer’s attention can be difficult for brands. This is why visual communication is more important than ever. E-commerce businesses should utilise visual tactics like high-quality photography, video and AR to keep customers engaged.
Data- Driven Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing is a strategy when businesses adjust pricing to reflect consumer demand. This is not a new concept, but new technology and AI can help in making pricing more accurate and accessible. Popular companies like Amazon have already implemented technology to optimise its pricing strategies and other businesses who follow this suit are seeing a boost in earnings.

Why Cloud and DevOps are better together
In today’s rapidly changing world, most companies want to increase their competitiveness, so they cannot ignore digital transformation. DevOps and cloud computing has become essential for companies to achieve digital transformation.
DevOps is about process improvement, whereas cloud computing is about technology and services. It is important to understand how the cloud and DevOps work together to help businesses achieve their transformation goals.
According to a report from IT analyst company Freedom Dynamics, using DevOps or cloud in isolation accelerates software delivery by 50%, but when used together, there is an acceleration of 81%, which means the productivity becomes much higher and stronger. So, the rewards are genuinely high.
IDC Technologies is a one-stop solution for Cloud and DevOps consulting in India.
Here are some reasons why Cloud and DevOps are better together
Cloud + DevOps accelerates software delivery
Migrating applications to the cloud provide an excellent opportunity to modernise the hosting platform and reap the benefits of modern cloud services. For example, DevOps solutions can reduce complexity and efficiently automate everyday maintenance tasks.
Combining cloud and DevOps helps streamline software delivery. Overall, developers and the operational staff can work strategically rather than haphazardly while dealing with large unanticipated tasks.
Cloud + DevOps improves operational efficiency
Adopting DevOps alongside a cloud platform offers a more seamless and focused route to improve operational activities. This is especially important for the organization that moves from start-up to scale-up status.
Cloud + DevOps improves scalability
Scalability is one of the key reasons for companies to choose cloud computing, helping them respond appropriately and cost-effectively to increase storage and performance according to the variations in their business.
Cloud + DevOps lowers total cost of ownership
As the usage of cloud services continues to grow, cost optimization will become a major concern for Chief Technology Officers. In this case, DevOps will help cut down the total cost of ownership by automating key components like application deployment and orchestration.
In our experience, an organisation that implements DevOps with the cloud can save money, accelerate innovation, and motivate team members. People become more energised towards their work. This will increase enthusiasm to change and fasten the improvement and advancement with commercial benefits.
As an organisation, be it a small, medium, or large enterprise, it is crucial to adapt rapidly and stay ahead of the competition, foster innovation, and run an efficient operation to continuously deliver new and high-quality products and services.
Cloud and DevOps go hand in hand. You may have one without the other, but they work much better together. You can enjoy many benefits of leveraging DevOps in conjunction with cloud computing. Together, DevOps and cloud computing are able to drive meaningful digital transformation that directly impacts business goals.
A DevOps consulting company like IDC Technologies can be of great help for businesses that are wondering about cloud and DevOps or want to use them together to streamline their processes, improve team communication and collaboration and accelerate time to market.

Checklist to Collaborate with a Tech IT Staffing Firm to Hire the Best Talent
Did you know 83% of businesses struggle to find employees with the right skill sets? Companies that can't fill positions with the right candidates may not succeed in achieving their business goals. This is where staffing agencies can provide you with the best hiring solutions to meet your business needs.
Are you planning to collaborate with a Tech IT Staffing Firm to hire the right talents?
If yes, then there are some things you should consider when choosing a staffing agency for your business.
Important checklists for choosing the best Tech IT Staffing Firm:
The niche of the agency
There are numerous IT staffing companies today that offer recruitment services but choosing the right one helps you hire exceptional talent. Are you thinking about how to find the best staffing agency? The answer is online research. It can help you find the right staffing agency with a stellar reputation and extensive experience in delivering recruitment services.
When you work with the best recruitment agency, you get the desired talent who not only fills the open vacancy but adds value to your company.
Understand the Recruitment Process
Old hiring strategies may not be effective enough to deliver good results. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the recruitment process of IT staffing companies.
Know how the staffing agency communicates, the hiring strategy, the kind of database they maintain, the latest tools they use to assess and acquire candidates.
You need to ensure that the recruitment process is thoroughly optimized and would attract skilled professionals that fit your organisation.
Check Candidates Database
The candidate database is the system to store all the information of active as well as passive candidates. Before working with IT staffing companies, understand how they find candidates. Do they use newspapers, employment websites, professional networking sites like LinkedIn, or job fairs?
Make sure the staffing agency you are working with has a large pool of candidates to ensure the best talents can be part of your organisation.
Analyse the Vetting Process
The venting process plays a crucial role in conducting a thorough investigation of a candidate's background. IT staffing companies verify candidates' educational qualifications such as degrees, certifications, professional licenses, work experience, social media profiles, and much more.
Make sure to be familiar with the vetting process of the staffing agency and check whether they are leveraging the new-age strategies to access and acquire qualified candidates.
Understand the Competitive Advantages
It is important that you know about the staffing agency's competitive advantages and unique value propositions that can bring you the best talent on board.
You need to understand how they build brand value, reach qualified candidates, position your company above your competitors, and how they provide their support post-recruitment.
Collaborating with a staffing agency like IDC Technologies makes your entire hiring process more streamlined. Having access to a large pool of skilled professionals, the company helps you find and hire the right talents for important roles quickly and in a cost-effective manner.

Home Blog DevOps As A Service: Why Startups Consider DevOps Outsourcing

DevOps As A Service: Why Startups Consider DevOps Outsourcing
In the current industry, DevOps is a leading practice that combines software development and IT operations. This enables the generation of a holistic experience for the team and ensures a high level of quality while delivering work. This new technology trend aims to optimise and shorten the software development life cycle and even increase the efficiency of production. Creating solutions to integrate development and IT operations is the core objective of DevOps.
Mogul corporations have access to a better workforce and larger funds, so it's easy for them to build their team of DevOps professionals who can single-handedly manage the task. In contrast, small businesses and startups can find it very challenging to set up such a department in their workspace. Therefore, third-party agencies that excel in providing DevOps as a Service (DaaS) can be beneficial for these companies.
DevOps service providers have access to specialised software solutions, the latest tools, and appropriate talent in driving faster processes and yielding better products. DaaS providers offer comprehensive integration, delivery, and deployment of the project. This way, companies are not only able to save time and resources but also keep the cost under control.
Keeping a regular check and maintaining the company's infrastructure that includes virtual machines and networks is crucial. DevOps agencies can help reduce sudden inconsistencies between the environments and even provide faster and more accurate testing by using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
DevOps outsourcing can be a valuable means to automate the workflow and manage the infrastructure smoothly in a company with multiple repetitive tasks. DevOps Architect, Automation Architect, and Automation Engineer can develop winning strategies for many tasks. Consequently, the in-house employees can get more free time and thus focus on the core business objectives.
One of the most significant benefits of relying on DevOps providers is that they can help businesses with automated testing procedures. While manual testing takes a lot of time, there is a high chance of human errors. Automation testing using DevOps ensures a faster process and proves to be accurate while saving resources and time.
Since its inception, DevOps has continued to grow and has even flapped its wings in the cloud domain. Businesses looking for cloud migration can partner with DevOps cloud service providers to efficiently fulfil their needs. Such service offers a robust system and better development and deployment of the projects.
One of the well-known branches of DaaS is DevSecOps which aims at providing appropriate security against various cyber threats. DevSecOps agencies can help you examine and determine any potential vulnerabilities in the system and even offer regular security checks.
Below is a rundown of the three main reasons startups should consider DevOps outsourcing:
1. Efficient Hiring
Interviewing, scanning, and selecting skilled DevOps professionals can be difficult, especially in such a competitive market. Handing over the recruitment needs to DevOps providers will help you fetch suitable candidates for your company. They not only have access to a large pool of qualified talents but follow rigorous hiring procedures to select the right candidates.
2. Great Experience
DevOps is a rapidly evolving technology, and therefore it is crucial to keep the team informed about the latest developments in the industry. It also includes training the professionals with any new tool and technique. DevOps providers keep their team updated and even provide relevant certifications.
3. Access to Better Resources
DevOps agencies have access to the latest tools, software, and technologies, can provide talented engineers, and consulting services to their clients. Managing complex projects and having solutions for any specific requirement becomes very easy with the support of the right DevOps service provider.
If you are looking for skilled DevOps resources and manpower to support your business, you can partner with IDC Technologies. IDC's DevOps consultants analyse the business needs, design and implement a DevOps solution that meets those needs, and help their clients attain their goals.

Home Blog Why 2022 Looks Likely To Bring More Widespread Late Payment
03-08-2022
Why 2022 looks likely to bring more widespread late payment
The coronavirus pandemic adversely affected businesses worldwide during the past two years, resulting in a significant drop in their performance and revenues. Several companies even faced bankruptcy. The fallback of one organisation created a negative impact on other businesses as well, much similar to a domino effect. This economic crisis started with late payments.
By the time the common public and businesses had a chance to regain equilibrium, they were introduced to another Covid variant. This non-periodic and unexpected spike in Corona cases has been pushing down the pace of economic growth. Even in 2022, when the new Omicron variant knocked on our doors, companies and financial experts were expecting (or were certain) that late payments will again cause an imbalance in the businesses.
As per the Institute of Directors (IoD) report, more than one-third of directors agreed that they had experienced an increase in late payments during the pandemic. Yahoo Finance also mentioned some of the world's big companies that went into bankruptcy during the pandemic, such as Gold's Gym, J.C. Penny, and Brook Brothers. Companies like Thomas Cook and Carillion were underperforming, which negatively impacted the rest of the supply chain. Consequently, this continued to fuel the cycle of late payments.
By offering various schemes and plans, the government has supported businesses during the pandemic. For example, the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) launched in May 2020 by the Finance Ministry of India aimed to provide relief to the MSME sector and other business enterprises amidst the global crisis. However, this scheme has been said to end on March 31, 2022. Similar to this scheme, other plans and offers given by various governments across the globe are approaching their expiration date. As a result, this has led to insecurity among several business owners. Therefore, the trend of late payments is seen not to vanish so soon and may continue to impact the world even in 2022.
Despite the government's best efforts, the ball actually lies in the court of businesses to efficiently manage the cycle of late and non-payments. Below we have discussed some measures that companies can take to fight this situation in 2022.
1. Being Proactive in Credit Management
Businesses should use the best credit control strategies to identify any signs of late payment. Also, companies should analyse well before offering credit to someone and use tools such as credit reports and account opening forms to manage the process.
2. Keeping Check Over the Cash Flow
Consistent cash flow is crucial for companies in sustaining their operations and workforce. Opting for credit insurance facilities and other funding schemes can be beneficial to ensure cash flow as it offers protection against late payments and bad debts.
3. Taking Actions for Debt Collection
Although a slight delay in receiving payments is a standard in every industry, outstanding amounts that are on hold for an extended period may remain unpaid. Therefore, partnering with an agency that provides excellent debt collection services can be really beneficial to ensure proper cash flow during such challenging times of the pandemic.
Businesses that are stuck in the cycle of late payments and look for a solution to get their amounts cleared in the fastest time possible should partner with a debt collection agency such as IDC Technologies. IDC has industry-specific experience and knowledge in speeding up payment from clients. Thereby, relieving the pressure on the in-house collection team and making businesses grow and sustain.

Business Process Outsourcing Driving Value In Rapidly Growing Economy
Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) can be an effective way to catalyze business activities by diluting the workload and transferring part of the organization’s responsibilities to a third-party vendor. A good BPO service provider helps understand the complications involved in a business, lays down a strategically planned roadmap, and executes it with the help of appropriately skilled professionals.
While the services offered by BPO vendors help cut down operational costs, it provides better market insight, customer behaviour analytics, and updated feedback related to business activities to the company. Generally, a BPO agency houses a range of services that include voice and non-voice based customer support, call centre work, data collection, user retention, and other such benefits that improve the customer’s journey.
In view of enhancing the customer experience, business owners and the company’s management hire a group of employees to connect with the customer. While this might seem easy, it involves a good amount of effort and time for the company to recruit, train, and manage the entire team. Moreover, it adds high costs to the company. In such scenarios, BPOs can do wonders.
A well experienced BPO provider can effectively make your business thrive by analyzing the pain points and taking steps required to tackle them, while your core in-house team can focus on more crucial tasks. Their overarching strategies for various sales, marketing and service-related operations will drive intelligent and exceptional growth for your business.
With the support of a well-established BPO agency, companies can increase their ROI, enhance the productivity of their workforce, and improve the agility of their business. Whether it’s a B2B or B2C business model, companies can leverage the expertise of a BPO vendor and create wider horizons for themselves. Bringing a positive transformation in the business environment, providing better flexibility and adaptability, securing long term growth are some of the other benefits of collaborating with BPOs.
Various organizations across the globe seek partnerships with excellent BPO agencies that can prove worthy to them. IDC Technologies is one such company that has years of experience in offering BPO related services to its clients that belong to a diverse range of industries. They have access to updated tools, technologies and skilled professionals who are capable of providing solutions aligned to your business needs and goals.

Big Data Projects Are Here to Stay
Big data is a collection of structured and unstructured data that is extremely large in volume. With the help of extensive amounts of information stored in big data, companies have access to much better insights into their customers’ behaviour and strategies. Excellent database applications and experienced data professionals are required to analyze and process the information stored in big data. Using this process, companies can improve their operations and create personalized marketing campaigns to increase their revenue and upscale their business.
Year-on-year, the big data volume continues to grow at a fast pace. This has influenced various enterprises to leverage this data to upscale their business. Moreover, many companies are adapting to the concept of transferring their big data processing to the cloud.
However, due to the unavailability of better infrastructure, the absence of skilled professionals, and high cost, achieving fully optimised results is becoming a challenge for organizations. This has made businesses realize the importance of investing in big data projects. Companies are ready to explore opportunities that will ensure their success and help find better and agile work processes. Achieving this goal will be easier if companies leverage the power of cloud computing in optimizing big data projects.
Many businesses claim to have data repositories in the range of hundreds of Terabytes. Having access to such a large volume of data enables organizations to integrate and stream data, conduct ad hoc analysis, and use machine learning at its best. Moreover, companies are witnessing a broader utilization of big data across various teams in their workspace.
As per the 2021 Big Data and AI Executive Survey by NewVantage Partners, 81% of the firms are positive about adopting this concept in the pursuit of becoming more data-driven in the coming future. Moreover, around 96% of the respondents in the survey claimed to have a measurable business growth as compared to only 48.4%, five years ago.
Additionally, the growth in the big data trend has prompted an increase in the popularity of open-source engines and technologies. Some of the widely known tools among them are Presto, Apache Spark, and Flink.
IDC Technologies is well versed in offering big data services that can help companies make smarter decisions to drive their business growth. They provide deep insight into the data by offering Data Consulting, Data Engineering, Analysis & Dashboarding services to help you make the right decision for your business.

6 Common Staffing Challenges & How to Overcome Them
The success of a company depends majorly on the efficient management of its workforce. This includes having appropriate and skilled professionals at the right position and time. Due to certain market uncertainties and complications that intervene, it becomes quite challenging for any organization to ensure smooth and productive staffing operations in their workspace.
In order to ensure a smooth workflow, it is imperative to have a dedicated team to handle the acquisition and management of talent. While businesses can have multiple important things to focus on, it is difficult for them to plan and execute an efficient hiring process. This process gets even more strenuous when there is a need to recruit professionals in technical and IT domains. Therefore, choosing the services of reliable IT staffing companies is essential, as they come up with strategies that can do wonders for businesses in their hiring journey.
At IDC Technologies, we have curated a list of 6 common challenges that companies face while fulfilling their staffing requirements and how they can overcome them.
1. Fluctuating Workload
There are various industries in the market, such as Ecommerce, travel, taxation & bookkeeping, and many more, that experience a seasonal or periodic peak in their business. Consequently, there is a need for more workforce to handle the work pressure and execute tasks. It is advisable for such companies to opt for temporary staffing or contract-based hiring to manage fluctuating workloads. Acquiring temporary employees during such peak times help companies control their costs and stay flexible in their recruitment journey.
2. High Labour Cost
Among all the expenses associated with running a business, employee salaries or labour fees comprise the highest costs a company has to bear. Collaborating with a good staffing agency helps you save on capital as they optimize the workforce by helping you achieve the right mix of full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. Moreover, sometimes the staffing firms suggest that companies offer certain benefits like ESOPs or incentive-based income to reduce the actual labour cost.
3. Talent Gap
It is quite challenging for companies to acquire employees that align with the skills and experience required for the position. The absence or unavailability of suitable candidates can hamper the productivity of the company. However, partnering with a well-known staffing agency provides access to a large pool of talents from various regions for vacancies across several departments. Moreover, when you pass on the responsibility of hiring professionals to a recruitment firm, you have the opportunity to focus on other crucial tasks of the organization.
4. Expensive Overtime
While paying in-house employees for working extra hours might seem to be convenient, companies can enhance their productivity and reduce costs by collaborating with a staffing firm. These firms provide temporary or part-time candidates who can manage the business tasks during the absence of full-time employees. Upon discussion, you have the liberty to pay such workers on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, which can save a good amount of capital for the company.
5. High Turnover
Turnover is the number of employees leaving an organization during a specified interval of time. While employee turnover is common, it can negatively impact a company if there is a high turnover rate. This even affects the team’s performance and pace of work. Therefore, quick action needs to be taken to tackle such challenges. With the support of a staffing company, businesses can easily fill vacant positions in less time. They have a large pool of candidates and can help you hire people with the right loyalties.
6. Welcoming New Opportunities
When new projects or business opportunities come along the way, companies should be prepared to accept the offer. This is possible only when there are sufficient and appropriate skilled professionals. To handle such immediate requirements, companies should consider partnering with staffing agencies that can quickly deliver qualified candidates. By doing so, organizations can openly accept new opportunities and grow their businesses.
Managing the entire business is quite challenging for any organization. To ease and smoothen the workflow, it is crucial to have skilled employees in their workspace. Therefore, it is advisable for companies to partner with staffing agencies, such as IDC Technologies, who can help them recruit experienced professionals as per their requirements. IDC Technologies offers flexible and comprehensive staffing solutions. Moreover, we provide talent development, talent management and HR process management related services.

7 Simple Steps To An Effective Robotic Process Automation Strategy
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a new-age technology that can conduct various human activities based on a set of computer programs. This entire process is automatic and does not require any human intervention.
RPA does not include any physical robot machine, but actually is an automated software robot that accomplishes various repetitive tasks such as billing, payroll, copy-paste, data management, and many more. This is the reason why RPA is sometimes referred to as a software robot.
Various data entry and back-office companies deploy RPA in their daily activities. With the rise of automation technologies, many employees think that RPA will take over their jobs. However, Harvard Business Review has reported that many companies adopting RPA won’t let any employees lose their jobs; instead, they will be re-employed to a more useful position in the company.
RPA offers a wide range of operational and technical benefits to an organization. Among them, some of the advantages are:
Accuracy - Since an automated system performs the task instead of any human, there is a reduced chance of any error.
24x7 working - RPA is easier to deploy in the long-term, even 24x7, compared to humans who have specific working hours.
Efficient productivity - Increased work output is achieved in less time.
While it can be quite feasible for small organizations to leverage RPA, larger companies should follow a detailed roadmap while executing it in their business. Hence, there is a need for a planned and strategic approach while deploying RPA at its best for getting maximum output. At IDC Technologies, we have compiled a list of steps that will help you design a plan for implementing RPA automation technology in your organization.
1. Identify The Process
To achieve excellent outcomes from RPA, you need to scan the entire business model and its operations to find out the processes that should be considered for automation. This will help you save a lot of time and resources and optimize this automation technique to get the best results. Look for processes that run on rule-based commands where exact formulations are used. Apart from this, processes with measurable attributes can be a good choice where you can deploy RPA, as it will help you evaluate the results or outputs efficiently. Moreover, processes that are repetitive, have high volume or are prone to human error, need the support of RPA.
2. Managing The People
While incorporating RPA in the business, it is crucial that all the members within the organization, right from stakeholders to entry-level executives, understand the benefits and influence of the software. Moreover, some employees believe that such advancements in the workplace may replace the efforts of the human workforce and they may end up losing their jobs. Therefore, it is the prime responsibility of the organization to bring the employees into confidence and communicate to them that RPA will help manage the redundant tasks, improve productivity, and not affect their employment.
3. Choose The Right RPA Tool for Your Company
Once you have outlined the strategies and selected the processes to automate, you need to choose the best RPA tool that aligns with your business needs to help you achieve the best results. Focus on the below-mentioned parameters that you should consider while selecting the right tool for yourself.
Vendor experience and their support.
Compatibility of the tool with various platforms and software.
User-friendliness and simplicity of the tool.
The extent to which the tool aligns with the industry type of your business.
Affordability.
4. Assessment of Economic Profitability
Implementation of RPA in the business might need a considerable amount of investment. Therefore, thorough scrutiny of business processes is required to note down the expected return on investment (ROI). It would be best if you made sure that profitability is guaranteed while deploying such automation strategies. To make things easier, you should consider involving the management committee and stakeholders to bring the best analysis report to the table.
5. Secure Endorsement from Stakeholders
Positive acknowledgement from the stakeholders is important to ensure smooth and efficient use of RPA in the organization. When an organization has the support of senior-level executives and the management, it becomes easier to bring other members in confidence. A dedicated effort from the stakeholders will help gain the trust of employees by letting them know the advantages of RPA and eliminating the thought of losing their jobs.
6. Educate and Train Your Employees
By taking the long-term view of the automation journey, we can make informed decisions at all stages. Your staff should be encouraged to contribute not only in maintaining the existing RPA project but also develop new ideas for the future rollout of programs.
7. Measuring The Performance
Create key performance indicators (KPIs) to track your RPA implementation's success. The candid evaluation will highlight any possible discrepancies and give you ample time to fix them. There should be more evaluations following the completion of the incubation period based on these standards so that any gaps in the successful RPA implementation plan can be identified and fixed as soon as possible.
We at IDC help optimize a company’s time and efficiency through our Robotic Process Automation services that use AI, cognitive automation and machine learning technologies. We take pride in stating that our specialization lies in identifying and automating labour-intensive and error-prone back-office tasks like data entry, account creation and data processing. Using our team of RPA engineers and a unique continuous improvement methodology, we simplify routine and repetitive processes for clients. With a holistic approach and overarching strategies to effectively implement automation technologies in various businesses, IDC Technologies could be an excellent choice to upscale the output and maximize the ROI for your organization.

Cloud Migration: Who's Driving Your Bus?
Companies are constantly looking to upgrade their traditional systems and IT workflow to adapt to the latest digital technologies; Cloud Computing is one of them. Effective cloud-based technology has become essential for businesses that want to incorporate agility, efficiency, and a positive transformation to give a tough fight to their competitors.
The old infrastructure and outdated technologies create stress in maintaining data and add to extra cost and time.
Migrating to cloud-based technology will help the company tackle the challenges and ensure success for their business. However, cloud migration can be a complex mission that may require a few weeks to a couple of months to set up. Since the in-house technical team doesn't have regular work experience in migrating activities, it is advisable (and essential) to collaborate with cloud experts who can proactively handle the cloud-based migration activity.
Migration to the cloud is a beneficial service for companies that want to get rid of outdated servers, inefficient firewall software, and so on. Before migrating all your data, tools, applications, etc., you need to understand factors such as the possibilities of risk, limitations due to server downtime, initial data migration issues, data security, among others.
Cloud experts or cloud partners are the main driving force that will lead to successful cloud migration for your organization. To set yourself aside from the confusion of selecting a potential cloud partner, you should consider the following critical points:
1. Understanding the business
Although you may find numerous agencies having experienced cloud partners who can assure you a successful migration, you should choose the one who understands your company. The potential cloud expert can easily justify your requirements and recognize your business, services, operations, workflow, geography, target audience, customer needs, among other aspects.
2. Clear service and deliverables
Before signing an agreement with the cloud expert, you should learn and understand the scope of their roles, lists of services & deliverables provided by them. It may also include the budget and timeline of the project. If required, lead a healthy discussion and opt for possible modifications in the agreement. Get a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that highlights all the key points precisely in detail. A strong SLA will ensure that the project flow is smooth and is not hampered anywhere in the process of completion.
3. Skills and experience
You can discuss with the cloud partners the tools, frameworks, and processes they use. You can even conduct a short technical discussion with them to understand their expertise and industry knowledge. Cloud experts with top accreditations and certifications set them apart from the rest and can be a potential partner for you.
4. Complete transparency
Keeping the stakeholders in the loop is crucial for making cloud migration a success. Necessary changes and modifications can be discussed and done at each stage of the process rather than revealing any error or technical mishap towards the end. Building a transparent real-time dashboard for clear visibility of the life cycle can be an excellent way to lead ahead. Check if the cloud partner is ready to provide you with such a platform. An ideal cloud expert should have minimum turn-around time on emails, calls, or messages and even offer end-to-end user training on cloud shifting.
5. Compliance with latest trends
Always go with partners who have a deep understanding of various cloud platforms. They can be a right fit for you if they can efficiently help you manage activities such as OS up-gradation, disk management, and SQL migration. They should have access to advanced and latest technologies, tools, and software. Check if your cloud expert has a partnership with other cloud providers and vendors to lead a successful cloud transformation for your organization.
6. Reviews and Feedbacks
An efficient way to evaluate your cloud partner is to learn about their experience and reputation in the market. You can fetch available online resources such as customer feedback, case studies, client testimonials, ratings, among other information. You could even check the previous projects they handled and the industries in which they have served.
Conclusion
It is high time that companies start moving their physical or virtual data centers to a cloud-based platform. It will help them stay aligned with the latest trends in the industry and ensure a sustainable future for their organization and its people. Cloud migration is a rapidly evolving technology and catching up with it as early as possible will prove to be beneficial.

An Intro To Recruitment Process Outsourcing
A great team makes for a great company. Hiring qualified employees is a crucial part of any organization's operation and growth. While each company has a dedicated HR team to manage its workforce, scouting for and hiring the right people may need extra efforts, understanding, and commitments. Due to the busy schedule and heavy workload, the HR team might not effectively process and fulfil the desired hiring requirements. Thus, companies can acquire the best talent by partnering with agencies that offer Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) services.
RPO is a part of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). The process involves a company that transfers some or all of its hiring needs to a third-party service provider to manage its talent acquisition and fill the vacant positions. Unlike the HR staff in a company who handle multiple people-related tasks, RPO agencies have a dedicated team of full-time recruiters with great experience and in-depth knowledge of the latest hiring trends. Hence, they can efficiently lead the complete process of sourcing, hiring, and onboarding new candidates for a company.
RPO providers proactively engage, plan, and discuss with their clients to create a transparent environment during the hiring journey. They even share recruitment analytics with the clients, helping them get a holistic view of the entire process. Since RPO agencies have different recruiters with profound niche experiences, they can do wonders for employers looking to fill technically advanced or specialized positions.
How do RPOs work?
RPOs follow a systematic approach to handle the entire recruitment process to keep it simple and organized.
Firstly, RPOs set up a virtual or on-site meeting with their client to understand their requirements and design a specific solution to fulfil their needs. Post that, an agreement or contract is signed between both parties. It contains information such as purview of the project, cost, time, among other details.
Once the formalities are through, RPOs actively engage in spreading the word about the job opening. They use various websites, digital platforms, and even social media strategies to reach the best talent. Upon receiving hundreds of resumes, they screen the best ones manually or using advanced AI-based algorithms. If required, assessments are also taken into consideration to filter the potential candidates. Following this, the agencies organize multiple rounds of interviews and finally present a bunch of candidates to the employer and assist them in selecting the right fit.
Advantages of RPO
Companies, be it small, mid-sized, or large, can benefit a lot from the services offered by RPO firms. Being an extension of the traditional staffing team of a company, RPOs can bring a wide range of advantages, including the following:
1. Saves time and money
RPOs generally work on strict timelines to cater to the hiring needs of companies. It ensures that organizations don't invest their valuable time in searching for appropriate candidates. The strategic approach followed by RPOs even reduces the per-hiring cost and saves a considerable amount of time and money for the company.
2. A large pool of talent
RPO agencies have an extensive repository of data containing thousands of updated CVs of skilled individuals. They have segregated lists of potential candidates from different backgrounds suitable for a variety of positions. According to the employer's hiring requirement, RPOs quickly get back with ideal candidates for the role.
3. Global hiring
RPOs can be a perfect solution for rapidly evolving companies looking to scale their service and operation in other countries. They can help companies cross local boundaries and hire the right candidate internationally.
4. Enhanced focus & energy
While RPOs work consistently and efficiently to acquire suitable talent, companies can focus more on their business and operations. The HR team can efficiently manage their current workforce by leaving all hiring responsibilities to the RPO agency associated with the company.
5. Follow guidelines
RPOs understand the importance of local laws and are always up to date. They ensure that the complete hiring process complies with hiring regulations of local, national, and international authorities.
6. Employment branding
Candidates looking for new jobs are eventually spammed with hundreds of calls, messages, and emails. While it gives them access to multiple job openings, it confuses them to select the appropriate one. RPOs develop a planned and strong message to connect with the talents and help the hiring company stand apart from the rest. Candidates can understand the job details and the company for which they are applying, making better decisions.
Conclusion
While good hiring decisions can do wonders, an inappropriate one can prove to be disastrous for the company's growth. It is advisable to hire someone with experience and understanding of market trends, access to experienced candidates, and the power to analyze your company's culture. A well-established RPO firm can help you with skilled and appropriate candidates suitable for any position in your organization.

The Role of Business Intelligence In Small to Mid-Sized Companies
What is Business Intelligence?
Business intelligence (BI) uses software tools that convert data into valuable insights, which enable businesses to make tactical decisions. These tools access and analyze large data sets and then present them into easy to read formats such as charts, graphs, maps, summary reports and such. At its core, business intelligence leverages data to make life easy for businesses today!
While business intelligence is known to be used by Fortune 500 companies, it would be a misconception to assume that it is only used by large corporations. Today, even small and medium sized businesses are realizing that they stand to gain much from the fruits of business intelligence software.
Besides being cost effective, these BI tools also provide data insights that enable such businesses to come up with better strategies in order to catch up to the competition. So, read ahead to know about 4 ways business intelligence can play an important role in the growth of small to medium sized businesses.
1. Fast & Accurate Decision Making
Using business intelligence tools allows companies to have access to real-time information. It allows them to examine the latest facts and then make crucial decisions based on this data, instead of merely relying on their instincts or previous year's reports. Now, small businesses can view trends as they are happening and act on them on time!
2. Improves Communication
The biggest advantage of using business intelligence software is that it allows for easy data sharing and collaboration within a company. Thus, businesses can take advantage of this feature so that different departments can get access to the same data for effective collaboration and decision making. These data insights can incredibly be useful even if you have a one-man team for HR, Accounting, or marketing instead of entire departments.
3. Gives Competitor Insights
Gone are those days when small businesses needed to rack their brains to understand what makes their competitors tick! With the advent of digital innovation, every business creates a huge amount of data and leaves a digital trail behind. A strong business intelligence software allows you to follow this trail and access your competitor’s data. From sales patterns to social media trends and even public financial records - there is much you can gain from your competitor with such data insights.
4. Helps in customer profiling
To succeed in boosting sales, a company needs to carefully understand customer behaviour and their buying patterns. This is even more important for small to medium sized businesses, as they have an imperative need to keep growing the business.
However, monitoring changes in real time and customer profiling requires mining tons of data. Moreover, these data insights are located in different locations, which makes it difficult to integrate it and summarize in-depth reports. This is why business intelligence software are used to better collate data and make the profiling process easier for businesses today.
At IDC Technologies, we specialize in providing you with highly effective business intelligence software. These tools and technologies will enable you to get access to better data and concise reports, which will enable you to grow your business to new heights!

4 Ways DevOps Managed Service Providers Can Transform Your Business
In a world transformed by the internet, businesses today need to innovate faster to match customer expectations. Today, software development is an integral part of any business, as companies interact with their customers through software in the form of apps, websites, and more. This is why businesses are increasingly turning towards DevOps to improve the speed and reliability of their services.
DevOps is a set of tools and practices that increase an organization's capacity to deliver software applications at a greater speed. Under a DevOps service model, the development and operations teams function as one single team. Here, the work of engineers is not limited to a single function; rather they apply a range of skills across the entire application lifecycle. From development and testing to deployment and then operations - every process is incorporated and improved upon under a DevOps model.
However, Is an in-house DevOps team as effective in practice as it is on paper?
While DevOps focuses on continuous innovation and faster delivery for the business, the fact is that it can be a challenging and time-consuming process in reality. There are many factors to consider for its success such as the required workforce skills, available technology resources, and the collaborative philosophy of people in your company. Instead, we believe that partnering with a good DevOps Managed Service Provider (MSP) will help you solve these issues, especially if you are a small or medium sized corporation.
Below are some reasons that tell you why such MSP firms give much better results and add value to your business.
1. Lower Costs
Partnering with a DeVops managed service provider ensures that you don’t have to hire excessively, which minimizes your labour and employee turnover costs. Moreover, such firms usually provide most of the technological support and let your business leverage the benefits of automation. Thus, MSPs prove to be extremely cost-effective for businesses that don’t have the required budgets for top notch IT technology or personnel.
2. Streamlined Processes
With cloud based technologies and efficient data management at hand, your business can truly take the advantage of a DevOps Servicing firm. DevOps processes that take time such as testing and deployment can be automated to achieve the required continuity in your DevOps business model.
Moreover, data can be securely stored on the cloud, ensuring that it is managed better to reduce downtime. Processes such as continuous integration can also be achieved easily to release new updates faster, address bugs quickly, and improve software quality.
3. Improved Speed & Reliability
A good DevOps servicing firm will always ensure that efficient processes are kept in place to provide a speedy service. Solutions are provided with lightning speed yet there is no compromise on the positive experience of your customers.
Tools such as DevOps automation accelerate the time required for each task whereas cloud-based servers allow their experts to quickly tackle issues via any network! Moreover, tweaks, errors, and customization are further addressed with a faster turnaround time.
4. Quality Collaboration
Quality MSPs are also efficient at good collaboration and provide DevOps teams with experienced professionals on hand. In fact - At IDC Technologies, we go a step further as our specialized teams ensure seamless communication with the business by maintaining a single point of contact.
This single point of contact serves as a middleman, ensuring that you do not have to interact with too many people to get the job done! This gets your issues resolved faster and thus improves the communication of the business with our firm.
The benefits of outsourcing your DevOps services are immense, as the right MSP can help you grow in a competitive business market and interact well with your customers. As a managed IT service provider, IDC Technologies can be the right companion for your business as we provide skilled DevOps resources and manpower. We understand the needs of your business, devise and implement a DevOps model according to it, and help your company reach new heights!

What is Company Culture & 5 Ways to Create A Positive Workplace
What Is Workplace Culture?
Workplace culture is the shared values and beliefs that people in a company live by every day. This culture can be glimpsed in their interactions, behaviour, and attitudes in the office space. These interactions are often largely influenced by the business's leadership and management system that manages the workplace.
At IDC Technologies, we believe that a positive workplace culture will let your employees thrive in their work and lead your business towards immense growth! In fact, a research survey by Deloitte has also shown that 94% of executives and 88% of employees believe that the success of a business depends on a distinct corporate culture.
A good positive work culture is what keeps the morale raised and reduces stress levels in the workplace. It leads to job satisfaction, better employee retention, increased productivity, and much more! To learn more about its importance, you can check out our article on Why Company Culture Matters!
So, how can you create a positive work culture? Here are 5 keys you can do so -
1. Establish The Core Values of Your Organization
Any business needs to have a set of core organizational values and ethics, which can be communicated to each employee of your organization. Remember that we're not talking about inspirational buzzwords used in your mission statements or marketing. These values need to be at the forefront of every aspect of your workplace and must be demonstrated through regular actions. This will encourage your employees to uphold these positive values and live by them in every part of their workplace interactions.
2. Create A Comfortable Workplace
A positive workplace can only be sustained by a comfortable environment, which trusts and supports every employee equally irrespective of their caste, gender, race, and sexual orientation. A business today must create a diverse and inclusive workplace where every employee can thrive!
Moreover, one must also encourage employees to freely voice their concerns and issues without fear of reciprocating toxicity. Stringent processes must also be set for workplace bullying or harassment. Such a comfortable workplace will serve to protect the mental health and wellness of your workforce.
3. Foster Good Communication & Teamwork
A management style that is focused on encouraging teamwork and transparent communication will contribute to the positive vibe of the workplace. A company should perform social interaction audits from time to time and welcome constructive feedback too. Businesses must also hold collaborative activities such as team outings frequently, where employees can develop friendships outside of work.
4. Set Clear Goals & Recognize Meaningful Work
Employees want to be valued and know that the work they do matters to the organization. This is why it is super important to set clear goals and a transparent growth path for employees within the organization. Accompany these set goals by motivating your employees every step of the way, training them when needed, and recognizing their achievements. Such a culture that celebrates every person's growth will infuse a positive feeling into your workplace and enable high levels of job satisfaction!
5. Offer Work-Life Balance
One of the biggest signs that a workplace culture is unhealthy is when employees show clear signs of being overworked and to the point of burnout! Instead of asking them to work overtime all the time, your culture should encourage the workforce to go home on time for some well-needed peace and quiet. Thus, they will come back the next day rejuvenated and perform better after getting their due downtime.
The key is to reward result-oriented work over the number of hours so that your culture promotes healthy competition instead of a toxic cut-throat atmosphere. Overall, a good work-life balance will ensure happy employees, and it will be easier to retain them too!
At IDC Technologies Solutions, our staffing strategies enable businesses to find candidates who fit right in their company culture. In this way, companies can work with professionals who share the same values and ethics, thus making for a holistic corporate culture.

Home Blog Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO): Fact Vs. Fiction

Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO): Fact Vs. Fiction
An RPO - recruitment process outsourcing is when businesses partner with a third party agency to fulfil their talent recruitment needs. Such services can be provided by specialized RPO agencies as well as certain consulting firms. A reputed RPO service can do much for companies today! Such a firm can lower recruitment costs, find the right talent to grow your business, and quickly refill your workforce with competent employees.
However - there are certain myths regarding RPO agencies, which is why many companies may be hesitant to try their services. Worry not! We're here to bust some of these myths and separate fact from fiction for you to make an informed decision.
Myth 1 - Partnering with RPOs Can Increase Recruitment Costs
Fact -
While many companies may feel that hiring an RPO is an added recruitment expense, this is far from the opposite! RPO agencies tend to share most of the company's recruitment costs in return for their fee. Moreover, such agencies also bring efficiency to the hiring process, making it a cost-effective deal for your business in the long run!
Good RPO partners have access to advanced technology and will also plan your recruitment strategy well. Thus, they could provide you with a large pool of candidates within a short time. This would ensure you find an employee quite faster than anticipated, thus shrinking the time and costs required to hire for the vacant position. Hence, partnering with an RPO shortens your time-per-hire as well as reduces your cost-per-hire!
Myth 2 - RPO Programs Offer Generic ‘One-Size-Fits-All’ Approach
Fact -
This entirely depends on the RPO service you choose. We recommend that you do your research well and choose an RPO that offers strategies and programs based on your company's hiring requirements.
At IDC technologies, our programs are configured based on the company's talent recruitment needs. From screening candidates according to the quality parameters set by the company culture to completing post joining formalities as required by the client - everything is meticulously done after considering the client's business requirements.
Myth 3 - In-house Recruitment Can Find Better Candidates Than RPO Agencies.
Fact -
The core responsibility of a recruitment process outsourcing service in India is hiring top talent. Because these services function with the top recruiting resources and have specialized skills, they tend to screen candidates faster in such a competitive job market.
While in-house recruitment teams may have a hard time keeping up with the changes in the recruitment industry, these agencies are always updated with new information. In fact, they can also get you in touch with candidates who may want to switch jobs but are not active on recruitment sites.
This is why even mega corporations tend to outsource parts of their recruitment process to RPO agencies despite having an internal talent acquisition team! Hiring such an agency to work parallelly with their own in-house team gets them quicker results to fill certain vacancies and reduces their own bandwidth of work to be done.
Myth 4 - Too Much Time Will Be Spent in Communication with RPO Executives
Fact -
This can be a true experience for some. To avoid this pitfall, you must look for an agency that offers transparency in communication and prioritizes your emails. You must also hash out all the communication channels of the RPO agency before entering any contract. At IDC technologies, we ensure that a business doesn't waste its precious time by constantly conveying requirements or even feedback to multiple IDC executives.
Our governance method is super transparent, providing fast and convenient communication for a client. There is one account manager stationed at the client premises who handles all the communication between the client and the offshore IDC delivery team. Hence, the client only interacts with one executive the whole time for all the requirements and deliverables!
At IDC technologies - our range of RPO services include sourcing resumes, screening candidates, lead generation, interview scheduling, business assessment, document verification, pre and post joining formalities etc.

What Is Customer Service And Why Outsourcing Is The Answer?
Customer service is the act of supporting a customer, where interactions happen between a company representative and a client who has purchased its product or service. Customer service representatives serve to improve the experience of the customer with the company. Whether it is answering their queries or troubleshooting problems, customer service teams and BPO service providers aim to nurture lasting customer relations with the company.
Remember that good customer service is vital for most customers to feel loyalty towards a brand. Moreover, customers are also likely to repeat purchases after a good experience with a company. However, after just one bad experience, studies show that half of the business’s customers will switch to a competitive brand. This number could quickly escalate in case of multiple bad experiences, thus derailing a business. Customers are a major stakeholder of your company, and such is their power today!
Now that you know its importance, what is good customer service? While the presence of automation and chatbots has become crucial for a quicker service, the presence of a human element such as a good customer representative will never go out of value for a business! And this is where BPO agencies and outsourcing firms can be invaluable players to further your business, especially if you don't have the resources to own an in-house customer service team. Read ahead as we list why outsourcing your customer service to such agencies is the answer to building better customer-brand relationships.
Benefits of Outsourcing Customer Service
Outsourcing your customer service gets you in touch with expert professionals who have the experience and immense expertise to deal with customers. Moreover, these customer representatives are good at communication skills, pay attention to the smallest details and are passionate about helping people in need.
 One of the biggest advantages of outsourcing your customer service are the reduced costs. An outsourced team of professionals costs far lesser than hiring the same number of customer service employees and providing them with additional benefits.
The reduced costs also ensure a huge competitive advantage for small and medium sized businesses that may not be able to sustain a large in-house customer service team. Outsourcing then places them at par with large corporations in the business world today!
As the entire world is more accessible to us due to technology, businesses today deal with customers all over the globe. In such cases, achieving an efficient round the clock customer service may get quite challenging for certain businesses. To meet this need, reputed BPO service providers in India provide 24x7 customer support in different geographical time zones.
Outsourcing your customer services also is an incredible help if a company uses multiple communication channels to interact with customers. Talking with tons of customers over the phone, voice calls, live chat messages, emails, social media DMs, and messages gets easier with an efficient system set up as per your particular business model.
Sometimes, businesses may face a seasonal spike during certain periods of the year. These sales contribute a major portion to their annual business turnover! To sustain the same level of excellent customer service during this time, such companies often partner with outsourcing agencies to have more hands on deck who can efficiently handle all orders and queries.
At IDC technologies too, we study your business well and devise a customer service strategy based on your needs. We then execute it with the help of our professional customer service teams who offer round the clock service and lightening quick response times! These traits set us apart from the rest of the outsourcing agencies in India.

Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing An IT Staffing Firm
With the IT world evolving quickly, it's no secret that businesses today require the excellent expertise of IT staffing and recruiting companies. In an industry such as this, finding and hiring the right candidates can get pretty overwhelming for a business. To save your precious time and energy, such staffing agencies come to your rescue as they quickly get you in touch with top IT talent. However, it is also quite crucial to know which agency will be the perfect fit for your business requirements. So read ahead as we tell you about 5 mistakes a company should avoid while hiring an IT staffing agency.
Mistake 1 - Relying Solely on The Agency’s Work Experience
While staffing agencies that possess the experience of 10 plus years are a great choice, one must also look for other things they bring to your business. Rather than only hiring the agency by taking its experience at face value, have a look at how well it has adapted itself to the rapidly changing IT technology over the years.
In this aspect, IDC technologies can be a great IT staffing partner for businesses! This is because we not only bring a robust experience of 13 years to your business, but also use updated systems that are at par with the leading IT trends of today. Besides our long experience and expertise, we also boast of high success in the form of 100% client retention!
Mistake 2 - Only Focusing on Your Technical Needs
Professional staffing agencies know that bringing only technical systems to the corporate table is not enough! To find the right candidate who is a perfect fit, there are several factors the agency needs to know about your business involving your work ethics, company culture, business processes, HR policies, position KPIs etc.
Such knowledge about your business will help the agency screen better candidates for you. In this way, you will know that your capital is being used for the right recruitment efforts. Hence, you must hire a staffing agency that wants to know all about your business instead of choosing one that is only interested in fulfilling only your IT needs.
Mistake 3 - Getting Lured By The Promise of Hiring Employees Who Work for Lower Pay
Many staffing agencies may promise to find you top talent in the IT industry who will work for lower than average pay. Remember that even if you land such a deal, the employee may leave your company at the first chance they get for a better offer somewhere else.
Thus, you will not only lose out on the best members of your workforce but will also end up increasing your employee turnover costs. A reputed IT staffing company, on the other hand, will offer your candidates a competitive salary as per their required pay scale to prevent them from jumping ship in the longer run.
Mistake 4 - Setting The Bar Too Low for Communication
Be it conveying its recruiting strategies to you or being responsive to your emails - a professional staffing agency will always be transparent and clear in its communication process. Look for such an agency that prioritizes your calls and queries, has a quicker turnaround time and gives timely feedback throughout the hiring process. At IDC Technologies too, we value your time well and our staffing service provides you with top candidate resumes within a mere 24 hours!
Mistake 5 - Partnering with a cultural misfit
Just as you wouldn't risk hiring a candidate that is a cultural misfit, the same rule goes for partnering with such an IT staffing agency. An agency that does not set much stock by your business ethics and values will derail the partnership quickly.
As a business owner, if your company values are based on transparency, timeliness, quality work and trust, then you must choose a consultancy that functions by the same values. This will develop a good bond between your business and the agency, where communication, trust and work ethics match to create one cohesive working team.
As an IT staffing and recruiting company that has been in this industry for more than a decade now, we too, function with certain such values everyday. Our core values encapsulate integrity, responsibility, reliability, and result driven work ethics. We have stood by these ethics in our service to each business that partners with us, which is why our clients continue to partner with us today!

Staffing Agencies - An Answer to Overcoming Direct Hire Challenges
When it comes to filling direct hire positions, companies are often left searching for the right fit for their business. In the current candidate-driven job market, recruitment can be quite a struggle for employers as they face many challenges to find highly qualified employees who will stick with the business for a long time. In such scenarios, a direct-hire staffing agency can be the answer to all these challenges! So read ahead to learn how such agencies can be a boon for your business, as they specialize in solving your recruiting issues quickly.
You Can Find A Large Pool of Top Talent Quickly
Good staffing agencies provide you with multiple channels to find the right candidate for your company. Besides screening candidates on job portals, they also get in touch with passive candidates who are not actively seeking jobs on these websites. Such highly qualified candidates may look for a job change if the right opportunity arrives. Recruitment agencies actively engage with these candidates and thus give your business an access to an even larger pool of qualified professionals.
Staffing Agencies Reduce Your Time-to-hire.
Partnering with a direct-hire staffing agency will significantly accelerate the recruitment process. Sometimes businesses can lose out on good talent if their hiring process is too long. To ensure that the entire process goes faster, staffing firms take over the initial evaluation, background checks, and screening process of the candidates.
With advanced technology and executives who specialize in such staffing tasks at hand, they are able to accomplish this job much faster! The agency essentially streamlines the entire recruitment process, which reduces the time to hire. This is quite crucial for a company that needs to fill an open position quickly.
Direct Hiring Costs Incurred Are Lower
While many companies may feel that hiring a recruitment agency may be an extra cost, it is quite the opposite as working with staffing agencies prove to be more cost-effective in the long run! This is because the reduced time to hire they offer plays a crucial role in deciding the overall cost of recruitment per hire. Essentially, the longer a position lies vacant, the higher the cost incurred as there is a loss in productivity. Thus, working with a good staffing firm that reduces time to hire is recommended to lower costs.
Moreover, businesses also save a lot of capital and resources by collaborating with staffing agencies. Not every small to medium business can afford to have an in-house talent acquisition team. In such cases, hiring a staffing agency is the answer as it can provide valuable direct-hire employees at a lower cost.
They Take Care of Post-hire Formalities
Staffing agencies not only take care of the hiring process but they also will save you the tedious trouble of performing post-hiring duties. From filling out important documentation to completing the onboarding - these agencies have processes kept in place to reduce the burden on your HR team. This also allows your company executives to focus on core corporate tasks to help expand the business.
At IDC technologies, we specialize in being the answer to major hiring challenges faced by companies today. We design perfect recruitment strategies as per your business requirements to deliver top candidates primed to succeed in your business. From handling niche to volume hires, we've been in this industry for a long time handling direct hire staffing needs for our clients across geographies!

Business Process Automation: A Complete Guide
1. What is Business Process Automation (BPA)?
Business process automation or BPA is the use of technology applications, which perform repetitive tasks or processes to free up manual labour. This is why business automation is so crucial for all types of organizations today!
The use of automation in business saves your employees from doing tedious, time-consuming jobs and instead focus on strategic revenue-generating activities. In fact, 78% of business leaders agree that employees could save around 60 hours per month, with automation systems in place!*
2. Key Benefits of BPA
In such a fast pacing world, automation can be your business's best friend if used well. From tracking shipments to streamlining processes and even predicting customer behaviors - the use of BPA can digitally transform your business, accelerate processes, and drive company growth. Here are some crucial benefits of BPA.
Streamline Operations - The use of automation in business enhances the efficiency of processes. This means quicker turnaround times, clear accountability, and higher productivity.
Reduce Errors - Since machine labour replaces human efforts, processes get standardized and chances of errors are reduced significantly. Due to standardization, operations turn reliable and one can get the expected outcomes each time without room for mistakes.
Decrease Costs - The use of BPA ensures that employees spend less time correcting processing errors or submitting paperwork. This reduces the manpower needed for the same job, thus saving you labour costs.
Upgrade Customer Service - Streamlined business operations also mean improved customer service! With automated processes in place, a company can consistently meet customer expectations with ease as well as solve resolutions quickly, nurturing customer loyalty.
Improves Visibility - Automated processes bring an element of transparency in the organization, where one can easily gain insight into what works for the company and what doesn’t. This helps you identify bottlenecks and thus further identify business areas that can be streamlined.
3. Common Uses of BPA
Almost all areas of a company require business process automation services. Here are some major areas where it is most useful to reduce costs, save time, and improve operations.
Marketing - Email marketing software send emails at a predetermined time to your client lists and ensure they get updates on time without much manual effort involved in the process. CRM (client relationship management) systems also send automated emails or DMs on social media as well as use data analysis to gain insight into customer behaviour.
Human Resources (HR) - From document processing to employee onboarding and interview scheduling, the HR team of a company handles a wide range of automated tasks. This reduces their immense workload and helps them focus on important administration tasks for the company.
Sales - There are separate sales automation tools that automate recurring tasks involved in the sales process such as qualifying the right leads and assigning potential clients to the right sales rep.
Finance & Accounting -Many businesses use modern bookkeeping tools, which means not having to pore over complicated spreadsheets. Automated invoicing generates and sends invoices to customers while accounts payable automation ensures timely payment to suppliers. In fact, automation is also used in employee payroll management, calculating tax obligations, and expense management.
At IDC Technologies, we ensure to bring effective BPA services to an organization after analyzing your business needs and requirements. This ensures that your workflow is streamlined and business growth is headed in the right direction.

Why Use A Staffing Firm for Full Time Hires?
The success of IT staffing companies cannot be denied when it comes to hiring full time hires for tons of businesses today. Good staffing agencies know how to get in touch with top IT talent, hire quality employees, and finish the entire process quickly to boot! So, what makes them better at recruitment than your in-house HR team? Read ahead to know why you must employ these firms instead of using your own valuable business time and resources in recruitment.
Staffing Firms Are Experts in Their Industry
While some businesses may use their HR departments for recruiting or employ general staffing agencies, this strategy may not work well for hiring in the IT field. This is because the IT industry is a large domain with many specializations that overlap with each other and where exact job titles are not the sole indicator of a perfect hire.
For example, your business may need a software engineer and your HR department will only know to search for such an exact job title. However, IT staffing firms know that this role can also be filled by a person whose job title is ‘software developer’. Since these agencies possess the right market knowledge and expertise in the IT industry, they make the perfect recruiting companion for businesses today.
You Get Access to Better Talent Networks
The right staffing agencies provide you with multiple channels to find the right candidate for your company and are not dependant on only online hiring websites. As they have been working many years in this industry, such agencies tend to stay in touch with an enormous pool of candidates. IT staffing and recruitment companies utilize these connections well in order to find the perfect candidates for your company.
Staffing Agencies Expedite The Hiring Process
With advanced technology and executives who specialize in recruiting tasks, staffing agencies usually accelerate the recruitment process. They save your business an immense amount of time as they quickly evaluate resumes, do thorough background checks, and handle the initial screening process of the candidates.
Such an agency essentially streamlines the entire recruitment process, which saves you a large amount of energy and stress associated with the hiring process. Time to hire is reduced for hires, thus making it easy for your company to fill open positions quickly!
You Will Incur Less Recruiting Costs
While many companies may feel that hiring a recruitment agency may be an extra cost, it is quite the opposite! Essentially, the longer a position lies vacant, the higher the cost incurred as there is a loss in productivity. As staffing agencies reduce your time to hire, it directly reduces these costs. Hence, the cost of recruitment incurred per hire is significantly lower. This is especially beneficial for businesses who cannot afford an entire in house acquisition team as it saves much of their resources and capital.
At IDC technologies, we design perfect recruitment strategies as per your business requirements to deliver top candidates primed to succeed in your company. Being experts in the IT industry, we specialize in quickly filling the open full-time job positions in top companies across the globe.

The Pros and Cons of IT Outsourcing

With new technologies coming up day by day, there has been a phenomenal rise of IT outsourcing firms that excel at streamlining many businesses today. Hiring a good managed IT service empowers your company to further enhance its productivity as well as address critical issues quickly. 
Since these firms are in touch with various competent agencies, they have the right resources and manpower to smoothen your business administration. But before you set out to hire such an agency, here is a list of pros and cons you must consider whether outsourcing your IT operations is the right choice for you.
Pros 
IT outsourcing ensures that your company can focus on core business initiatives. Be it taking care of your entire IT infrastructure or handling daily IT streamlining tasks - the efforts of these professionals ensures that your employees can instead focus on their deliverables and grow your business. 
A good IT outsourcing firm can provide you with advanced technological resources that will put you at a competitive advantage in the business world. This can be quite a boon for small and medium businesses who want to equip themselves with better technologies to be at par with large corporations. 
You can also get access to a larger talent pool with professionals who have immense expertise in a range of IT domains. This is especially valuable for startups and small businesses that do not have the resources to build an entire in-house IT team. Such staffing flexibility not only provides you with round the clock support but also ensures quick project deliverables! 
Outsourcing IT services help you lower a range of costs! We’re talking about eliminating labour costs as well as staff recruitment and training expenses. Besides this, reputed managed service providers also have a proactive approach towards system maintenance, helping you avoid the immense costs involved in dealing with downtime.
As good IT outsourcing firms specialize in cybersecurity and doing robust compliance checks, this enables your business to effectively combat cyber threats such as spam, malware, phishing, and identity theft.
Cons
Some businesses today attempt to create a hybrid IT workforce by mixing outsourced professionals with their own IT team. While these models can be effective with the right leadership, they may often instead cause communication issues as well as harm the morale of your own employees if they feel undervalued.
While you can provide directions as to what your desired aim is, as a business owner you may have to give up a certain amount of control. This is a given when partnering with contractors as outsourced consultants are often working offsite.
Sharing your data and IP is always risky. When tied up with the wrong firm, your data could be at risk. However, the best way to avoid this is to research about a particular firm and ask them about their data protection policies before signing a contract. At IDC Technologies too, we are transparent about our data security policies, which keep your business data absolutely safe!
Hiring an IT outsourcing consultancy does not necessarily mean that you may get the best results. In fact, sometimes they may give your business a disappointing quality of service! 
To combat these cons, it becomes super important that you carefully pick an established firm that retains most of its clients, possesses immense experience, and will serve your business efficiently. This is why IDC Technologies can serve you well as we have all the above qualifications, which will allow your business to reach new heights.

Home Blog How Does Outsourcing Help Desk Benefit Your Business?

How Does Outsourcing Help Desk Benefit Your Business?
Right at the forefront of your company is the 'Help Desk' - a team or even a one-person army that interacts with your customers day in and day out to preserve the positive image of your business. From solving client queries to escalating customer issues and even resolving basic IT problems - a competent Help Desk can hardly ever be under-estimated! This is because its savvy professionals excel at politely putting out the fires that erupt in the company throughout the week. 
However, this often leaves Help desk & IT professionals stressed at their job, and thus customer support is the first thing that takes a hit. So, how do you prevent this? Read on ahead as we recommend how outsourcing your entire help desk to competent BPO service providers instead can keep your business going strong and help avoid angry customers! 
Why Outsource Your Help Desk? 
Besides manning the company desk end to end, these professionals are required to be industry experts, have immense experience solving IT problems, and be excellent at customer support. Such expertise and professionalism can easily be found in BPO services and outsourcing firms, which ensure to hire as well as train the best people for the job!
Naturally, this saves companies a lot of time and money that could have instead been spent on recruitment, employee turnover, and acquiring equipment to maintain the help desk. Since all these services are managed by the outsourcing firm, partnering with these agencies can be relatively cost-effective as well as time-saving for companies today.
What are the Benefits of Outsourcing a Help Desk?
1.Greater Flexibility 
While your employees may have gone for the day, a professional from the outsourcing agency can instead work with greater flexible hours and quickly help a customer in need. This is because an outsourcing firm has a range of professionals scattered in different time zones, which allows them to effectively provide 24 hour support to your clients and employees even outside peak hours.
2.Better Industry Knowledge 
No one wants to hire an employee who may appear confused in front of the customer when asked to solve a difficult query. This is why reputed BPO service providers employ top-notch experts who are not only skilled in customer service but also possess competent IT knowledge to resolve your clients' issues. This makes for a much better help desk for companies today!
3.Rapid Response Times
An in house customer support team may get overwhelmed by the large number of incoming client issues that come their way. This may decline their response time, resulting in slow resolutions of customers' problems. Outsourcing firms, on the other hand, have several technicians on call to immediately solve these issues. 
Moreover, these firms also possess improved computer technologies, which enable them to solve problems remotely on rapid response time. This is especially useful during the ongoing pandemic scenario, where most of the world is working from home today!
4.Improves Customer Experience
Most help desk services are trained to deal with customers - be it on call, email or even live chats. From providing call flow support to resolving their technical problems and doing follow-ups with customers about their experience - a professional outsourcing team can do so much to help your customers who in turn grow your business! Such an efficient process ensures that your customers stay happy, while your employees can focus on their core responsibilities instead. 
As one of the reputed outsourcing firms, IDC Technologies is an established BPO service provider in India. We provide you with excellent IT and Help desk support to ensure that your business functions seamlessly and improves its levels of customer satisfaction.

5 Sure Signs You Need A Debt Collection Agency
A difficult part about being a small or medium-sized business owner is when you see a number of your clients not paying their bills. At this stage in your business - you have little time on your hands to go chasing after your customers for every unpaid invoice. In fact, as these debts get old, it becomes even more difficult to collect them from your client!
This is why hiring a professional debt collection service may be in your best interest today as they can recover your deserving dues quickly and efficiently, without you having to compromise your valuable time and energy. Here are five signs that tell you it may be time to contact a debt collection agency. 
1. Overdue Receivables Are Impacting Your Cash Flow
One of the most obvious signs that you may need the help of a debt collection agency, is when the overdue bills you need to collect keep mounting. In fact, they now impact the cash flow of your business, where you are incurring regular losses. This is why it’s advisable to not wait too long, otherwise, you may reach a point where you will be unable to pay your own bills!
2. Collecting Bills Take Up Your Precious Business Time
For any business, time is of the utmost importance. The minute collecting debts from your customers interferes with your time that is used to do core business tasks, it may be time to hire a collection agency. These services will collect these debts professionally for you, saving up your immense time and energy in the process!
3. You Don’t Have Dedicated Staff to Handle Collections
One bad debt collection strategy that many businesses may invariably opt for is asking their accounting bookkeepers or even sales professionals to collect overdue bills from their customers. This burdens their workload, harms morale, and there is a chance you may lose good employees! As for sales reps, their role is to nurture good relationships with the company customers. Sending them back to collect your debts may hamper client relations and thus your business.
Instead, it's always better to employ a good debt collector to recover your bills. This is because they know the nuances of debt recovery laws, deal with customers professionally, and yet maintain good relations with them. Your debtors too, are bound to take them more seriously and will quickly pay up for fear of getting sued instead.  
4. Accounts Show Unpaid Invoices That Are Older Than 60 Days
If you see a frequent number of accounts where payments are not being made even after 30 to 60 days, it’s the right time to contact a collection agency. After 60 days, these accounts are considered ‘delinquent’. This is when you tie up with a  debt collection service that will work on recovering these funds from your debtors on your behalf. If you wait longer than this, you may incur more difficulty in collecting your debts. 
5. One Of Your Debtors May Be Going Bankrupt
Look for telltale signs such as repetitive bouncing checks or no response at all to your frequent attempts at communication by the client. Chances are that your debtor's business may be running out of money, and your instincts tell you that the debt may get written off if you don't act on time. So, don't wait too long and hire a collection agency to do your work.
While these signs suggest that you are in need of debt collection, you must also ensure to do some research and hire the best one out there. These agencies should also possess licensing certificates, error insurance policies, and have significant knowledge of legal ways to recover debts. At IDC Technologies too, we specialize in getting you in touch with such top-grade debt collection services who will collect your dues quickly and efficiently, all the while maintaining good relations with your clients.

How HR Outsourcing Can Help You Boost Efficiency?
HR teams play a vital role in maintaining the smooth day to day running of an organization. However, many businesses today find that it is super easy to instead outsource HR and payroll services and get even better efficiency than a full-fledged in-house IT department! This not only reduces the humongous hiring costs but also improves cohesion and increases productivity organization-wide. Here are some ways in which outsourcing HR services can boost performance in your company.
1. Enhance Productivity
The outsourced HR team becomes a key point of access for all employees in the organization. Furthermore, all information is centralized on the HR portal where employees can quickly access all their information, upload documents, and get a clear understanding of the company policies. 
This allows the company managers to ditch the paperwork and instead focus on crucial revenue-generating tasks and analyse employee performance for better outputs. Thus, all employees in the company function at peak efficiency doing core business tasks while the outsourced team manages the HR functions.
2. Streamline Processes
Outsourcing to competent HR agencies ensures that all related processes are streamlined in your company. From taking on cumbersome tasks such as payroll, appraisal process, recruitment, onboarding, and more - outsourcing can be a boon for many businesses today! This especially levels the playing field for small and medium-sized businesses that lack the resources to hire entire in-house teams for such non-core business services. 
3. Ensure Compliance
Professional HR consultants come with a large experience in managing legal matters. They review existing company policies as well as maintain legal paperwork to ensure that everything is in full compliance with existing labour and safety laws. This shields the employer from sticky legal situations such as investigations, disciplinary actions, and complications that may arise with certain employees etc. This is quite crucial for small-sized businesses that do not yet consist of a full-fledged HR team.
4. Improve Employee Retention Rates
Since outsourced HR teams are trained well to work super efficiently, they help businesses to quickly solve issues and speedily reply to employee queries. This keeps your employees happy, leading to better retention rates. This means that you won't be stuck in a constant cycle of hiring and onboarding new staff. 
In fact, HR Consultants bring different perspectives and opinions to your company that are not clouded with judgement. They develop mutual trust and help resolve different issues and minor obstacles that crop up in the company. This reduces stress in the office, leads to a good corporate environment and thus improves workplace efficiency.
5. Scale Infrastructure
As your business grows quickly, you may need to scale up your HR functions to manage the rising number of employees and the mounting tasks in the company. Instead of hiring new HR professionals, you may simply outsource more services from the HR outsourcing firm to optimize operations as well as reduce hiring costs!
At IDC Technologies, we’ve given you top reasons why outsourcing agencies such as ours play a huge role in maximizing efficiency, thus leading to business growth. From HR operations to staffing services - our agency provides professional solutions with a quick 24-hour turnaround time to ensure that your business achieves new heights!

Home Blog Should A Small Business Hire A Collection Agency?

Should a small business hire a collection agency?
Is your business suffering from unpaid invoices that mount up month after month? This is where collection agencies come into play as you can outsource your collection services to them, thus effectively recovering payment dues from your clients all the while saving your time to grow your business! Such debt collection managed services have proven to be quite a boon for many small to medium sized businesses.
What do collection agencies do?
As a small business, you may have little time on your hands to go chasing after clients to collect your due payments for services rendered. Besides, as these debts get old, it becomes even more difficult to collect from the client. Collection agencies save you from all this trouble by being the middleman and collecting your debts for you for a small commission. Once the debt is collected from the client, they are compensated with a previously decided percentage of fees from the total collected amount.
So should you hire a collection agency?
If you see a frequent number of accounts where payments are not being made even after 30 to 60 days, it’s the right time to contact a collection agency. The agency then works on recovering and collecting funds from such delinquent (where payment is more than 60 days late) accounts for you.
If you do hire an agency, we would suggest that you do some research and hire the best one out there. Ask about things such as licensing certificates, error insurance policies, and their knowledge of legal ways to recover debts. Remember that a good collection agency will maintain good relations with your clients while still collecting your dues efficiently. At IDC Technologies, we focus on streamlining your invoices as well as help you get in touch with such top-grade collection agencies.
Key benefits of hiring a top notch collection agency:
Knowledge of legal laws
An experienced collection agency knows the various laws and regulations when it comes to the debt collection industry. This is why they are best suited to navigate these various laws and employ the best techniques to pursue your payment dues ethically. This eliminates the risk of well-informed clients trying to sue you or the agency on the grounds of violation of rights.
Offer various flexible programs
Collection agencies offer different programs suited for various business models. This allows you the flexibility to choose a program that fits well with the needs and requirements of your business. Besides, some agencies work for the commission after debt recovery, others may work for you for a flat fee. So, you also have the option to choose an agency according to your convenience of payment methods.
Enable faster recovery of debts
When a debt collection agency gets in contact with your clients, they tend to pay a lot faster! This is because such agencies pose a legal threat for your debtors than you do, as non-payment of debts tends to negatively affect a debtor’s credit score. Thus, the payment process is accelerated, without you having to spend your immense time and efforts trying to recover these debts.
Maintain crucial documentation
Collection agencies maintain records of each time they contact the debtor. In extreme cases, in case a business decides to sue a debtor, these records work as important documentation to show during court proceedings that the business made every possible effort to recover the debt. In fact, these documents may also be helpful for filing for tax deductions if the payment dues cannot be done by the client.
Now that we’ve given you all the information on collection agencies, you can make an informed decision based on your business requirements. We believe that such third party debt collection services are a great way for you to focus on your business, while also ensuring that you recover your funds from clients on time.

All about the BPO Industry in India
What is Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)?
Business process outsourcing or BPO refers to contracting standard business activities to a third-party agency. This BPO service provider effectively manages all non-core business functions and even innovatively applies technology to improve upon these processes. This form of outsourcing started around the 1990s in India and has only boomed since then!
India is now the most favoured market for BPO services, especially when it comes to catering to US and UK based companies looking to outsource their IT-related business processes. This is because the Indian BPO market offers highly skilled talent, cost-effective labour, 24/7 services, and a large pool of English-speaking professionals to companies worldwide. In fact, this sector has also created employment opportunities for millions of people today!
What are the services offered by Indian BPO companies? 
A BPO service provider in India usually provides you with the following services:
1. Customer service:
This calls for 24-hour call centre services that address and solve customer queries and complaints via telephone, mails, live chat etc. As businesses grow, so do the customers! Companies can now save on huge hiring costs by outsourcing their customer services to such BPO agencies.
2. Technical support & IT help desk:
This includes everything IT related - right from product installation to maintaining infrastructure and troubleshooting problems. Many BPO services also offer IT help desk services to companies in terms of offering support in office productivity tools, system problem resolutions, multi-channel support to interact with customers, and much more.
3. Data Entry & processing:
Data entry can be quite a tedious and time-consuming task to accomplish. Instead of focusing on such a non-core yet essential task, companies usually outsource these to BPO service providers today. This includes all data entry from books, yellow pages, e-books, websites, documents, catalogs, mailing lists etc.
4. Bookkeeping & Accounting:
These services involve maintaining a company’s account ledgers, financial statements and bank reconciliations. However, top grade BPO services not only maintain these accounts but also improve on them by performing audits, drawing up budgets, providing key financial insights and more!
5. Online form processing:
Activities in this category include payroll processing, insurance claim form processing, medical billing etc.
6. Human resources:
From taking over the recruiting to accelerating the appraisal process and reviewing company policies - Human resources are the backbone of a successful company. This is where HR outsourcing can prove to be a cost-effective gem for small and medium sized businesses.
7. Marketing services:
These services include interacting with leads and promoting a product to these potential customers for client businesses. From SEO to content and telemarketing - there are so many ways in which BPO marketing services can help a business!
8. Research & data analysis:
This involves activities such as conducting surveys, product and market research, data analysis and more. Such data driven research proves to be extremely useful for marketing agencies, investment firms, pharmaceutical businesses, etc.
At IDC Technologies too, we provide most of the above services! From IT support to financial solutions and even debt collection - we excel at providing customer satisfaction and high-quality services. Our innovative support ensures that all types of businesses end up saving on excess operational costs, work with skilled professionals, and get full-time support in a world where everything is changing by the minute.

Home Blog How Does Field Maintenance Service Look Like In 2021 And Beyond?

How does Field Maintenance Service look like in 2021 and beyond?
Field Maintenance Services has had a few of the most challenging months due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The usual way of doing business took an unexpected turn. Companies had to restrict, and in some cases pause entirely in-person field visits.
Businesses had to re-evaluate their business model in some way. Some of them had to embrace the idea of contactless or remote service.
Now, as we continue to navigate through the pandemic with a beacon of hope toward the future, let’s examine the field service trends for 2021 and beyond.
Remote Service
Field service visits can be costly, especially with the labour costs, travel time, vehicle expenses etc. Companies knew that remote work is less expensive but have realized it during these difficult times. They are now accepting new ways and ideas with able technological aid to work remotely in order to reduce operation costs and boost productivity.
However, even in the current scenario, consumer expectations are still in the pre-COVID era.  A new study on consumer expectations of technicians and technical support found that most still expect their providers to resolve complaints and problems as quickly and effectively as before with 75% choosing remote service unless utmost necessary.
Adopting New Technologies
Due to COVID-19, customers have started embracing new technologies and relying on software and guides that can help them in quick problem-solving. This means that companies now have to jump on the IoT, AR and VR bandwagon with long-term goals to provide remote services successfully.
These new technologies will not only facilitate technical tasks but will also improve operations and customer lifetime value.
Example: A software can offer step-by-step repair instructions when imposed over a device, making it possible for customers to fix the device on their own. Or the field technician can use smart glasses with AR & VR technology such that he can see what the customer sees and provide live customer service remotely.
Focus on Safety and Risk Management
The year 2020 has taught us that safety should always come first. Even in 2021 and beyond, the safety of the employees and customers will be at the forefront. Field technicians are concerned about their health. Customers want assurances of safe service and in-person visits are as safe as possible.
A set of 2 pre-screening questionnaires can be used. One to identify the severity of the problem and another to gauge the risk of exposure a technician has for different jobs, especially in high-risk population zones. This can turn out to be a risk management trend for foreseeable future.
So, to ensure safety, companies will have to resort to technology.
Example - Companies can make use of mobile applications where field technicians can submit all the paperwork through the app.
A lot is changing not only in IT field services but in the field service industry today. As digital transformation accelerates, field service won’t just be reactive, but proactive.
The next step for companies into field services will be to put these trends into action.

Home Blog What Should You Do When Your Debt Goes To Collection?
05-09-2021
What should you do when your debt goes to collection?
What are debt collection services?
A debt collection service is an agency that recovers past payments dues on behalf of creditors. Such collection agencies generally get hired by creditors when payments are not made for 30 to 60 days. After 60 days of not paying the debt, these accounts are considered delinquent and may get handed over to the debt collection agency.
Once the debt is handed over to the collection service, they will try to recover the creditor's unpaid funds for a small fee or commission. This is when they contact you for payment. If you find yourself in such a situation, here are some things you can do to swiftly eliminate your debt and improve your credit score.
What should you do if your debt goes to collections?
1. Review the debt
If you're contacted by a collection agency, carefully cross-reference if the debt amount reported by the agency matches with your account books. After checking if all information stated is accurate, you may verify the debt within a period of 30 days.
This is also a good time to determine how old your debt is and if it extends beyond the statute of limitations. If this is the case, the debt may be considered time barred, which means that the creditor or collection agency may not be able to sue you for it.
2. Know your rights
As a consumer, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) in India gives you certain rights in order to regulate the behaviour of debt collectors.  For example - Debt collectors can only contact you from 8 am to 9 pm. They cannot contact you at your workplace, if you have indicated to them that it is inconvenient. They also can't engage in verbal abuse or threaten arrest.
These laws are kept in place so as to ensure that debt collectors don't engage in abusive behaviour to collect the payment. Instead, the debt collection services in India are encouraged to settle matters in a polite way. Knowing your rights prevents you from being harassed, and helps you to settle your debts with dignity.
3. Negotiate the payment
It's always better to pay the owed amount in full, especially if you don't want to hurt your credit score. However, if you are ready to pay your debt in instalments or want to settle on a lump sum amount that is slightly less than the disputed amount - you can always negotiate with the collection service to arrive at a mutually beneficial payment plan.
For this, you can also seek help from a non-profit credit counselling service that can work with you to set up a repayment plan or even negotiate on your behalf. If the negotiation works for all parties, get the agreement made in writing! Once your last payment is made, ensure that the creditor or collection service reports your debt as "settled" and closes the account.
4. Get it cleared about whom you need to pay
Once the amount that is needed to be paid is cleared out, it is time to decide whom you need to pay. Usually, one clears off the debt directly with a creditor. But in case a debt collection agency is handling the debt, you may need to settle the payments with them. Whatever be the case, it is highly crucial here to get it in writing about whom you need to pay, to avoid any possible confusions later.
5. Consider hiring an attorney
Worst case scenario - if the situation gets messy with a debt collector, it may be time for you to hire a lawyer! After that, all communications are done between the debt collection agency and your lawyer. Another thing to keep in mind is to never ignore a summons from the court, as it may then invariably rule in the favour of the collection agency leading to the freezing of your bank account or garnishing of your wages.
How to dispute a debt, if it is not yours? 
If a debt collection agency has made an error and contacted you about a debt you do not owe - you can dispute this matter. Once the debt collector has contacted you, you can send a letter within 30 days to the collection agency asking them to not contact you unless they can provide proof that the debt is legitimate. The agency will then verify its claim. You can also dispute the matter if you believe that the owed amount stated by the agency is incorrect.
You can refer to the sample letters on the official website of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
These are all the possible ways you can amicably work with debt collection agencies today to settle debts with creditors. We always recommend one to never ignore one’s debts, especially when one is being contacted by a collection agency. In such situations, it’s always best to tackle debts head on, take control, and settle your debts in full to avoid landing in court.

Home Blog 5 Reasons Why Payroll Outsourcing Can Be A Boon For Startups & SMEs
05-09-2021
5 reasons why Payroll Outsourcing Can Be A Boon for Startups & SMEs
1. Saves Time and Enhances Productivity
Time management is one of the most crucial aspects of growing a business, especially for startups and SMEs. And in-house payroll processing often tends to consume a lot of time for the business. Keeping accurate track and maintaining a large amount of data that includes paid time offs, new hires, bonus benefits, and tax change requirements can get quite tedious! As staff numbers grow - this process only keeps getting more cumbersome.
A payroll processing firm, on the other hand, will take all these tasks off your hands and get done with them in half the time to boot! In this way, your employees are instead completely focused on the core business tasks to help generate more revenue.
For example - Besides salary processing, IDC Technologies manage reimbursements, do income tax computations, handle statutory compliances, and even install an issue resolving cell. Our firm's team of experts can quickly provide a range of services to help you save precious time and enhance the productivity of your business.
2. Cost Effective
While large corporations often have in-house payroll departments, it can get quite expensive for startups and growing businesses to maintain the costs of hiring a team of full-time accounting professionals as well as give them additional benefits! This is where payroll outsourcing can be quite a boon as they require to be paid only for the services provided to the business.
Moreover, such outsourcing firms also do the job of an entire payroll team! They also find cost-effective solutions in your payroll system and help you avoid government penalties. In the long run - it proves to be a super cost-effective system!
3. Gives Higher Accuracy
Because such outsourcing firms invest in top-notch technology - they can provide quick HR and payroll management solutions to businesses. Access to technology such as robotic process automation (RPA) as well as cloud-based servers bring in the high accuracy and better transparency that is required for payroll processes.
In fact - some agencies also tend to integrate payroll systems with HR so that the information that gets updated by them is easily accessible for payroll management. Moreover - it’s even better if IT staffing and recruiting companies (such as IDC Technologies) offer payroll outsourcing, as it leads to even more integration with the HR management system to streamline the payroll process.
4. Ensures Compliance with Current Laws
A lot of growing businesses often tend to struggle when handling payroll policies as per the required government regulations. Complex laws, ever-changing tax regulations, PF percentages, and employee benefit errors can often become audit issues for the company that may lead to hefty penalties.
In this aspect - payroll services always keep updated with the right information and have the perfect expertise to make your entire payroll system compliant with the current laws of the government.
5. Improves Data Security
While many are of the opinion that data may be less secure outside the company - this is quite a myth! In fact - there are a lot of risks also associated with in-house payroll, such as server unsafety, identity theft and embezzlement.
Reputed payroll outsourcing firms on the other hand, have secure safety policies in place to ensure that your company's critical data is safe. They often save your data on secure cloud-based servers and have the top encryption technology in place!
At IDC Technologies too, such confidential data is given the top network security and at times a virtual domain network is also created for payroll processing. In fact, record-keeping too, is done in an isolated area to ensure further physical security. With our varied efforts - we ensure that your data is in safe hands as well as all payroll functions are done efficiently.

Home Blog What Is BPO, Types Of BPO And Emerging BPO Trends In 2021

What is BPO, Types of BPO and Emerging BPO Trends in 2021
Business process outsourcing (BPO) has gained popularity with companies ranging from Fortune 500s to startups over the last two decades. The global BPO industry is forecast to reach a revised market size of US$230.2 billion by 2027 exhibiting a CAGR of 5.2%, after posting a devastating decline of -28.7% in the year 2020.
Thus, the question that arises is ‘Why not use BPO?’ and ‘What makes outsourcing essential?’
1. Adaptive to provide to the clients
Outsourcing non-critical functions allow organizations to focus on core competencies and essential business functions. Moreover, with BPOs having remote working solutions in place, companies no longer have to worry about the quality and delivery of the work. The process of meeting and scaling up to the company’s need can be quicker and easier.
2. Cost efficiency
Outsourcing operations lead to more cost savings because of economies of scale and specialized processes. Moreover, American organizations can accrue tax savings through outsourcing. Also, companies that outsource their business can adopt variable cost models instead of being bound to a fixed cost model.
3. Better Performance
Companies can hire specialized BPO service providers for different processes. E.g. Lead generation and nurturing, political call centre, improving the sales and marketing efforts. Moreover, with numerous productivity tools and technologies being implemented – the 2020s can be the era of tech-enabled soaring productivity.
Now that we have told you how BPO can improve business efficiency, let us understand the types of BPO services:
1. KPO
When companies outsource work to a service provider for their specialization it is called Knowledge Process Outsourcing. Companies usually avail their expert services for a specific business function or for their domain expertise or both.
2. LPO
Legal Process Outsourcing is similar to KPO but is limited to legal services. They provide their expert services such as conducting legal research, providing legal advice and so on. The services are typically used for back office outsourcing.
3. RPO
Research Process Outsourcing is also a type of KPO which basically conducts research and analysis function on behalf of businesses.
4. ITES
Information Technology Enabled Services is a type of BPO that delivers IT services by leveraging technology. Some of the work which ITES BPO conducts are technical support, data warehousing, IT service desk and such.
Emerging BPO Trends in 2021
1. Focus on social media
Social media is a game changer. Companies have now realised that and want to gain first-hand insights on customer engagement and trends as well as into product issues and address them in real-time. As a result, BPO service providers will now have to invest in new technologies, tools and teams that can drive business intelligence through social media
2. Startups as BPO customers
Startups and small businesses are constantly under pressure to succeed and show profits. To cut costs, they are very likely to outsource talent to build their business ideas. Thus, a well-managed service provider or a BPO company can help startups and small businesses to concentrate on their business and improve their bottom line.
3. Transparency
It is a known fact that transparency results in better partnerships between clients and suppliers. BPOs are bound to keep some level of secrecy. However, with smaller businesses and startups opting for BPO services, they are now bound to ensure a higher level of transparency.
With the focus on businesses to run cost-effectively, the BPO industry is placed on a better side and the outlook for the global Business Process Outsourcing industry is highly positive in 2021.

Myth 1 - Sending financial details to a payroll outsourcing firm is not secure.
Payroll outsourcing companies are instead better equipped to handle the security of your servers! Since such firms are more honour bound to maintain their reputation - they make your data security their top priority. Most such firms maintain cloud-based storage systems, maintain virtual domain networks, have top encryption in place and do routine safety checks to ensure that your business data is safe.
Myth 2 - Payroll outsourcing is expensive and only suitable for large corporations.
In fact, it’s quite the opposite! Maintaining an entire in-house team of full-time accounting professionals can get quite expensive, especially for small and medium sized businesses!
In this case, payroll outsourcing firms come to the rescue as they can provide the same expertise with a team of professionals and better technology at a relatively affordable cost.
Additionally, you only pay such manpower consulting firms for the services you hire whereas you may need to give additional benefits and manage overhead expenses for employees. Besides this, payroll outsourcing firms have the right experience to help you avoid hidden costs and government penalties. This turns out to be even more cost effective for your company.
Myth 3 - It will be inexpensive if I do the payroll myself.
While it may seem inexpensive, the job of payroll management takes immense time and energy to be accomplished each month! And for any business - time invested is literally converted into money. The more amount of time you and your employees invest in doing core business tasks, the more it increases your revenue.
When you engage in managing the payroll yourself - the tedious tasks it requires such as maintaining large databases on paid time offs, new hires, reimbursements, tax rate changes, and more may take a heavy toll on your valuable time. In the long run - losing out on such time may impact your profit turnover, leading to losses.
Myth 4 - Providing data to a payroll outsourcing agency will take too much time.
Since payroll outsourcing agencies use top grade technology - they are able to take your manual payroll process and transform it into an automated standardized procedure for your company. Thus, their integration systems and cloud-based servers will be able to access your business data quite quickly. Besides, reputed agencies may be able to quickly and accurately accomplish payroll processing in half the time your business now requires!
Myth 5 - Payroll outsourcing firms will not understand my business model.
Since such firms continually work with the top businesses in the world, they are better equipped to understand your business model. Based on your business needs - they may even suggest the right payroll processing strategy for your business! Moreover, their accounting efforts may further help you analyse payroll reports better as well as gain new financial insights for your business.
Myth 6 - I will still need to hire an in-house accountant.
The presence of payroll accounting agencies itself eliminates the need of hiring an in-house accountant! Reputed firms in this field have the right experience, top technology, and a team of professionals to streamline all financial aspects of your business. Whether you still hire an in-house professional or not - is completely your choice.
At IDC Technologies - now that we’ve busted some general myths about payroll processing - we hope you gained a deeper understanding of how payroll outsourcing may benefit your business. Be it a large corporation or a growing startup - we specialize in efficient payroll outsourcing for all types of companies to help your business achieve new heights without worrying about mundane tasks such as payroll.

Supply Chain Trends and The Future of Supply Chain Management in 2021
Supply chains make up an essential aspect of most businesses. It was predicted that supply chain will spearhead better customer service before the end of 2020. But we all know how Covid-19 affected pretty much everything, let alone supply chains. Not to mention, how it had detrimental effects on businesses.
So, let us see what Supply Chain Management has in store for 2021?

1. Resilience
The pandemic has forced organizations to focus more on how their supply chains operate. There is a growing need for supply chains to adapt, be more flexible and react on a timely basis to sudden disruptions.
In order to achieve resilience, organisations will need to take a step back and take a corrective course if need be on the following:
Weak links in the supply partnerships
Critical areas on supply chain process that are completely out of control
Any possible disruptors in the supply chain

Subsequently, to achieve resistance, supply chains need to focus on:
End-to-end shipment tracking
Act on insights presented by data
2. Technology to the Rescue
Digital twins such as blockchain and AI can recreate an entire supply chain and its processes in a digital environment with real-time data. This helps in giving a clear picture to businesses on customer orders to orders being delivered through the chain. Moreover, it can help in identifying any gaps in the chain and possible repercussions.
3. Supply Network Collaboration
One thing that 2020 has taught us is to put heavy reliance on collaborations. A single supply chain can be fragile, but a supply network can work its way out to serve the end customer under trying circumstances. Moreover, they can unlock greater value from new and existing partnerships.
Lay a foundation with a partnership mission statement which can help in eliminating any friction blocks while effective collaboration
Have in place a set of cohesive policies, processes and approvals that can act as a framework for effective partnership
Take ownership to avoid a quick plunge in the partnership.
4. Growth in E-commerce
Changes in customer preferences and global pandemic triggered the way we shop. A recent survey revealed that 88% of people plan to continue purchasing online and we expect more and more people to join the e-commerce shopping bandwagon.
This is good news for e-commerce business and will have plenty of opportunities to grow and innovate in the supply chains.
5. Re-shoring
Re-shoring will be a leading trend in 2021 when it comes to supply chain management. Manufacturers will try to reduce dependency on materials produced abroad and may even transfer their overseas business operations to original locations. It may lead to significant advantages such as speedy delivery, superior product quality and quick response to customers.
However, it is important and much needed to adjust the entire supply chain towards a more geographically spread production. Businesses will have to re-determine which parts of their production will be global and which will be local.
2021 will definitely bring in new challenges to businesses in the supply chain. As a managed service provider, IDC Technologies offers global expertise and resources to manage all your supply chain needs extending across the globe for a multitude of product types.

What Is ERP? Guide to Enterprise Resource Planning
A key to any successful business is the efficient handling of data and smooth streamlining of all core operations of the company. And the major contributing factor to the growth of your business is the right use of technology. This is where ERP software comes in handy to provide the right enterprise resource planning solutions to meet all your business needs. Read ahead to learn more about ERP and what it can do for your business:
What Is ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)?
ERP is a kind of software that helps you run your entire business by integrating all major business processes into a single platform. This means the integration of various aspects of your company operations such as purchasing, human resources, inventory, marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, finances, and more! This helps in the effective planning and management of business resources for optimum growth.
Rather than being a single program, ERP is a stack of applications that work together well to effectively manage data as well as ensure a seamless interlinking of all business activities. Besides basic integration, most modern ERP software now also use the latest technologies such as AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning to efficiently automate business processes in the company.
Benefits of ERP for businesses
Workforce visibility and streamlined operations
With ERP systems, businesses can consolidate fragmented processes onto one platform to get real-time details of various activities being simultaneously performed at different locations. This allows companies an insight into workflow visibility, streamlining in operations, and efficient scheduling solutions.
Business Intelligence (BI)
ERP systems enable Business Intelligence (BI)! This means that ERP software consists of efficient tools that handle as well as collect data, run analytics, and provide progress reports. Together, these functions are called Business Intelligence tools. Such data can then be analyzed to make better business decisions as well as easily provide data to company stakeholders to show progress.
Efficient communication across departments
With this software, multiple departments can effectively communicate and collaborate with each other across different time zones and in multiple languages. This is possible because ERP communication tools record every piece of documentation, phone call recordings, emails, texts, and more.
High data security
Since all important communication and documentation is on a single platform, with data duplication being impossible - ERP software help keep your sensitive company data safe from fraudulent practices and malware.
How to decide if your business needs ERP?
Following are some situations that may be indicators that your growing business needs the stability of ERP software.
Your business struggles with inefficiencies using different technologies
Software expenses are higher than normal
Your current software is unable to fulfil timely orders or customer demands
Business processes such as doing data entries take up the time of your workforce.
Your business relies heavily on big data, and you’re finding current programs to be insufficient for accurate storage.
If you face any of these challenges in your company - it’s high time to head over to a trusted consulting agency such as ours to upgrade your business processes with ERP. At IDC Technologies, we provide the best ERP solutions that are customizable according to a company’s unique needs. This helps businesses to seamlessly integrate all their operations, enhances productivity, and helps them thrive in the world today.

Home Blog Everything You Need To Know About Payroll Management

Everything you need to know about payroll management
What is supply chain management (SCM)?
Good Hr and payroll management solutions are the backbone of every successful company today. To run a business effectively - one needs to have a thorough understanding of these particular functions, especially payroll processing. So, read ahead as we tell you all about payroll and lay down all the basics of payroll management
Planning
This aspect requires businesses to plan, manage and account for all resources that may be required to meet the customer demand for a company's products or services. When the supply chain is carefully thought out and well-established - a company then determines the metrics that are used to measure whether the supply chain incurs sufficient profits, provides value to customers, meets company goals, and is entirely efficient.
What is payroll management?
In simple terms, payroll is a list of employees who get a salary each month from their employer. As a business function, payroll management is a huge process! From calculating each employee’s gross salary to releasing payslips and depositing various dues as per government laws - there is a lot of work that an accounting department or payroll officer of a business does on a regular basis.
Why is effective payroll management crucial for a business?
Besides the amount of work involved, businesses also need to be highly accurate while processing payroll. This is because even tiny errors while managing payroll can amount to huge losses and penalties for a company! Every business is accountable as it needs to be compliant with current payment laws as well as issue salaries on time to its employees. A business that is proficient in processing payroll each month will always have happy and satisfied employees.
What are the stages of payroll processing?
Payroll processing can be divided into three main stages - pre-payroll, actual payroll and post payroll activities.


Pre-payroll
Defining a standard payroll policy
Input gathering from company departments
Input validations
Payroll
Calculation of net salary
Post Payroll
Statutory compliance
Payroll accounting
Actual payout
Sharing reports


Pre-Payroll
The first step for a company is to define its standard payroll policy. While doing this, various factors are taken into account such as its attendance policy, leave and benefits policy, and more. Once the payroll policy is defined, it is then approved by the company management.
Another major pre-payroll step is to gather employee input data from major departments of the company such as HR, Finance etc. This involves all important information such as salary revisions, attendance, deductions, etc.
Once these inputs are received, companies then check for the validity of this data. These validations involve doing a headcount of active employees, using the right formats, checking if the data adheres with company policies, ensuring that there are no gaps in the financial transaction information etc.
Actual Payroll
The validated input data is then fed into the payroll processing system. At this stage, the net pay for every employee is calculated and verified thoroughly for accuracy. The equation for this is:
Net pay = gross salary - gross deduction
Post-payroll
Activities at this stage of the process involve various making statutory deductions, maintaining records, transferring the payouts to employees, and sharing payroll reports.
At this time of payroll processing, statutory deductions are made such as TDS (Tax deducted at source) and EPF (employee provident fund). These are then remitted to the respective government agencies and then returns are filed as required.
After this, the actual payout of salaries is done to all the employee bank accounts and a salary bank advice statement is sent to their bank branches. Salary payslips are also published, which are sent to the employees.
The company then updates the paid salaries in the accounting books. This is also where every piece of data needs to be accurately checked while being fed into the company's accounting system.
Finally, when the payroll is completed for the particular month, various reports on employee costing are shared as per the requests made by the company management.
At IDC Technologies, we’ve given you complete information on how payroll is processed by companies today. However, this process when done in-house by businesses takes up a large chunk of their time, energy, and resources. This is why many companies now tend to outsource their payroll management to agencies such as ours in order to focus their efforts towards business growth.

A Simple Guide to Supply Chain Management
What is supply chain management (SCM)?
Supply chain management is the handling of the entire production flow of goods and services, which help a firm transform raw materials into final products delivered to the consumer. Such a network of suppliers’ functions like the links of a chain to help move the product each step in the system - right from the suppliers of raw materials all the way into the hands of the customers.
When used the right way, businesses today can highly benefit from their supply chain systems! By managing their supply chain processes well - companies can significantly cut excess costs, deliver products faster, improve brand image, analyse sales data to manufacture products as per demand, and do much more to beget greater profits!
What are the key components of a supply chain system?
Any traditional supply chain system will have these 5 key components that need to be managed efficiently for businesses to thrive well:
Planning
This aspect requires businesses to plan, manage and account for all resources that may be required to meet the customer demand for a company's products or services. When the supply chain is carefully thought out and well-established - a company then determines the metrics that are used to measure whether the supply chain incurs sufficient profits, provides value to customers, meets company goals, and is entirely efficient.
Sourcing and Procurement
In this stage, companies locate the least expensive suppliers who provide the goods and services needed to create the finished product. This includes doing activities like market research, scouting, negotiation, and quality checks. Once the sourcing team has identified suppliers, the procurement team is then responsible for key processes such as budgeting, ordering, managing inventory, communicating with suppliers, etc.
Manufacturing
This is where the actual raw materials are transformed into the finished product! Besides manufacturing the desired product - this stage of the supply chain involves performing activities such as accepting raw materials, testing for quality, warehousing activities, preparing packages for shipping, and more.
Delivery and Logistics
Finished goods and services have to move fast through the chain to meet the expectations of customers. This is where firms utilize delivery channels and logistic services to move packages across rail, road, and air to deliver the desired goods and services into the hands of the customers. Activities during this stage generally include processing customer orders, scheduling deliveries, dispatching loads, receiving payments, generating customer invoices etc.
Returns management
Companies also need to account for creating a network where unwanted or defective products can be returned to the firm. The goal here is to manage the reverse process efficiently and identify opportunities where return requests can be minimized. Managing returns may have an adverse impact as there are extra transportation and inventory carrying costs incurred by the company. These expenses should be well taken into account while managing the company's return policies efficiently.
Managing these components of the supply chain is crucial for companies as it can help them achieve several business objectives. Controlling these processes well can help a firm enhance the quality of their products, improve customer service, and even minimize the risk of lawsuits!
At IDC Technologies - we can get you in touch with the right supply chain managed services that will look after the unique needs of your business and help you churn greater profits.

What are the key benefits of outsourcing payroll?
As small and medium sized businesses keep growing, their accounting teams often suffer the huge brunt of managing payroll! This is where third-party agencies come into play as they provide you with top notch HR and payroll solutions that are suited according to your unique business model. They streamline and maintain all your tedious payroll processes, so that you may freely focus on expanding your business. Here are some of the key benefits that such firms offer to all types of businesses today!
Besides managing payroll, such firms will take away your cumbersome task of keeping an accurate track of paid time offs, new hires, bonus benefits, tax change requirements etc. This saves you immense time and energy that can be effectively used to further increase your business profits.
Such agencies invest in the top grade technology that ensures quick and efficient payroll solutions for your business. Access to modern technology such as robotic process automation (RPA) as well as cloud-based servers brings in high accuracy and better transparency that is required for payroll processes.
Partnering with such firms proves to be super cost effective for your business as they do the job of an entire accounting team! This saves you from the high costs required to hire and maintain a team of full-time accounting professionals!
Some agencies such as ours tend to offer both HR and Payroll management solutions, integrating the two services for better streamlining of such processes. This also leads to fast information upgrading and easy access to employee records.
Compliance with government rules and regulations is the most crucial aspect of handling payroll! Even minor mistakes while calculating PF percentages or employee benefits can become large audit issues, leading to hefty penalties. Payroll firms help you avoid such risks as they are highly experienced in making your payroll system compliant with the current laws of the government.
Outsourcing payroll also enhances productivity as it frees up your accounting personnel, which enables them to focus on more important tasks such as strategies on how to increase your business sales revenue.
In-house payroll comes with its fair share of risks such as server safety, identity theft and embezzlement. This is why outsourcing works better as reputed payroll firms have secure safety policies in place and use updated encryption technologies to ensure that your company's critical data is in safe hands.
At IDC Technologies too, we maintain top network security, create virtual domain networks if necessary, and even do record-keeping tasks in isolated areas to ensure the safety of your business data.
With the right information, you can now focus on finding the right payroll firm that fits well with your business needs. You can start by heading over to our website to know more about all the HR and payroll solutions that we offer at IDC Technologies.

Home Blog What Is Technology Consulting And The Role Of Technology Consultants?

What is Technology Consulting and the Role of Technology Consultants?
The 21st century gave birth to a new world where there's hardly any aspect of our lives that isn't equipped with technology today. Likewise, all businesses too, require the right technology to help the world economy reach new heights. This is where technology consulting solution firms come into play as they guide businesses on the most efficient ways of using technology to leverage business growth. Read ahead as we give you an in-depth view into what exactly technology consultants do!
What is Technology Consulting?
Technology consulting firms advise businesses on how to gain the maximum advantage from technology to expand their business. They also implement strategies that aid in streamlining business operations, reduce IT costs for the company, ensure cybersecurity, and enhance productivity.
The core advantage of working with a technology consulting firm is that you can eliminate the high costs required to hire and maintain an entire team of IT professionals. Not only do you get matchless expertise in the numerous IT domains but you also save a significant amount of money as these consultants require to be paid for a specific project or time frame.
These firms also understand that technology is constantly evolving. Thus, they constantly upgrade their expertise, invest in top-notch IT equipment, hire excellent IT professionals and rethink management strategies that align with the goals of businesses. This is why they prove to be incredibly beneficial when it comes to planning a solid IT strategy for businesses.
At IDC Technologies too, we hire around more than 200 IT experts each month who offer businesses skill support in areas such as Infrastructure & Security, Web Technologies, Mobility, Testing, ERP, and Mainframe.
What is the Role of Technology Consultants?
Technology consultants not only need to be experts at what they do but also be excellent at communication skills as they often interact with senior managers of many companies to understand their business needs. They need to be quick and efficient at their problem-solving skills, to help businesses in the nick of time whenever necessary. Here are some roles that technology consultants play for businesses today:
Suggest better software or hardware solutions for businesses to better organize files online, which reduces extra manual work for employees.
Advise clients on using cost-effective IT systems, understand how it impacts the different departments of the company, help integrate these systems, and even maintain them for smooth business operations.
Do security checks, help maintain network and data security, train staff to counter cyber threats such as phishing etc.
They also do big data analysis, which helps to find the most optimum way to collect and analyze data of the customers of a business. This makes it easy for finding this information when needed for company campaigns.
They also do risk assessments, maintain documentation, and show progress reports that can later be used for company analysis.
Some are also involved in providing efficient sales support and maintaining cordial contacts with client organizations.
As the field of technology is in constant development, the above-mentioned roles are a mere fraction of what these consultants can possibly achieve for companies today! Their effective technology consulting solutions prove to be a boon especially for small and medium-sized businesses, where the costs can amount quickly in maintaining infrastructure or hiring IT help.

Home Blog Top 7 Staffing Trends Of 2021

Top 7 Staffing Trends of 2021
The traditional paper CVs, arduous pen tests, and long hour interviews are long a thing of the past. Today's recruitment is more than a resume with candidates being evaluated about passions and skills that go way beyond the traditional job role.
Recruiters now look for employees who are effective communicators, innovative in strategy, meet deadlines and have basic technology skills. To meet such staffing demands - IT staffing and recruiting companies often ask employers and employees both to update themselves time and again. So, read ahead to know more about the top staffing trends that will dominate the recruitment market in 2021.
Millennial work culture
Since millennials are a major chunk of the working population, they often have a great influence on workplace culture. These employees expect transparency in communication, digital competency, creative outlets at work, and flexible work culture. In 2021, businesses are predicted to adhere to these core millennial ideals to make the office more appealing to the quintessential working professional.
Employer branding
According to a report by LinkedIn, around 75% of candidates consider an employer’s brand before even applying for the job! From looking up reviews at Glassdoor to checking the company’s social media page - job seekers want to know everything about a company and its work culture.
This is why employer branding is the key to building a solid reputation online. This year, companies will invest more in employer branding through websites, social media, and professional networks to attract the right candidates who contribute to scaling the company profits.
Remote work
Covid-19 changed the way businesses functioned, where companies had to manage an entirely remote workforce. With work from home being the norm last year, many businesses have seen its numerous benefits and now show signs to continue with it too. Remote work may become a permanent part of life for many working professionals even after the end of the pandemic.
Virtual recruitment
The pandemic also had a significant impact on the hiring process itself where virtual hiring entered the staffing scene. Now, companies could hire anyone from any part of the globe which liberated job seekers from being tied to the locale of the employer. Unrestricted by location, IT staffing and recruitment companies too could look for the top talent at a quicker pace. This is why the businesses of today are predicted to invest more in virtual interviewing and hiring technology.
DEI inclusivity
According to a study by Bullhorn - did you know that only around 16% of all leaders in the staffing industry are people of colour!? However, recent years have highlighted such issues related to workplace inequality with steps being taken to incorporate diversity in workplaces.
Moreover, organisations that take care of the needs of everyone in equity and possess a diverse workforce have proven to be more excellent businesses than their counterparts. DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) in the workplace is set to be one of the top staffing trends in 2021.
Internal talent mobility
Often a lack of particular talent in the marketplace inspires companies to train their present employees to do multiple jobs at the same time. This is called internal talent mobility. Such a movement of employees according to the needs of the business works out well for the company as well as the employee.
It allows companies to redeploy employees to a high demand area of the business instead of laying them off. For the employees, it is a great chance to upskill and explore new talents. Such a technique creates loyalty in the organisation, strengthens the workforce and is especially useful during times of economic distress! This year may see a spike in internal talent mobility.
Hiring staffing agencies
With too many job seekers in the market - it is often time and energy consuming for corporations to hire the right talent. Finding and keeping golden employees who provide value to the business and help scale the profits is one of the main goals of a growing company.
This is why many businesses tend to outsource the hiring process to IT staffing and recruitment agencies who do everything from background checks to screening top candidates for them. It's quite the easiest way to focus your energies elsewhere in the business, while they do all the hiring work for you. At IDC Technologies, we provide staffing services for project-based hires, temporary staff, full-time professionals, and more!

As businesses keep growing, so does our need to hire field maintenance technicians. Not only are these individuals extremely vital for the smooth functioning of business operations but they are also much needed to ensure good customer services. So, read ahead to know how technicians from field maintenance services prove to be timely superheroes for tons of businesses today!
Provide technical support
Field Maintenance technicians offer major technical and IT support to companies for effective streamlining of their business operations. Since almost every kind of business uses these services - field technicians work for all types of industries to install hardware, integrate software, upgrade telecom systems, and do much more! They are heavily involved in the general upkeep and maintenance of technical systems.

Besides repair and field maintenance services - these technicians also ensure to do preliminary checks and have preventive upkeep processes in place to avoid major technical problems before they have even arisen! Their unique forethought of solving smaller issues to prevent larger problems generally tends to save companies a lot of money.

A professional field technician will always arrive on time, provide effective solutions, and generally be good at communication with your customers - thus improving your customer service!
Generate detailed reports

Home Blog How HR Consulting And IT Staffing Companies Help To Streamline Your Business
05-09-2021
How HR consulting and IT Staffing companies help to streamline your business
Be it small start-ups to large corporations - every business needs the right guidance to employ top recruits, manage its personnel, and aid in the smooth running of company operations. Here is where HR consulting and IT staffing companies come into play as they help you acquire new talent, provide competent HR services, and payroll management solutions. Read ahead to know how such agencies play a key role in the growth of your company.
Ease the businesses’ recruiting process
Right from helping you search for top talent to screening candidates and conducting interviews - HR consulting and IT staffing companies ensure that you find an employee who is a good cultural fit and provides immense value to your business. Their intense background checks and screening process also saves the company a lot of time and energy during the hiring process. Such HR firms aid you in growing large teams from scratch who will manage the workload to serve an increasing rate of customers.
Help employees to perform at their best potential for the company
IT staffing agencies also help the company with end-to-end management of employee appraisals. They initiate the work performance review process, have one to one meetings with employees and coordinate with management for swift appraisals. This ensures that the business is investing in the right employees, each of whom contribute to the success of the company.
Besides this, HR services also include conducting surveys to help the business understand employee behaviour, job satisfaction, and their aspirations.
Review and Improve company policies to ensure compliance with government laws
Most importantly - HR consultants review and improve on existing company policies to ensure that everything is in full compliance with existing labour and safety laws. Moreover, they shield the employer from sticky legal situations such as investigations, disciplinary actions, terminations, and more.
They also help to manage most of the legal paperwork, especially when it comes to onboarding new employees. This leaves you free to expand your business without worrying about getting entangled in endless red tape.
Help you plan a strategy that is suited for your business growth
HR consultants tend to bring immense experience and knowledge of best business practices to your company. This is why they can offer solutions specific to your business and customise a strategy that leads towards growth.
They give recommendations to further improve company practices and take over processes such as attendance tracking, employee time management, and payroll. Such HR and payroll management solutions result in good productivity, ensure growth, and streamline business processes.
Solve everyday issues while the company can focus on expanding the business
HR Consultants bring different perspectives and opinions to your company that are not clouded with judgement. They develop mutual trust and help resolve different issues and minor obstacles that crop up in the company. This reduces stress in the workplace, leads to a good environment and gives you more time to pursue business growth.
At IDC Technologies, we’ve given you reasons why HR consulting plays a huge role in the growth of businesses over time. From HR operations to staffing services - our agency provides quick professional solutions with a 24-hour turnaround time to help ensure that your business reaches new heights!

Home Blog 7 Benefits Of Hiring Managed IT Services

7 Benefits of hiring managed IT services
A managed service provider takes the responsibility of handling the staffing requirements, IT maintenance, and smooth administration of your business. Outsourcing such services save your business the immense time and energy required to accomplish non-core business tasks.
Hiring a good managed IT service provider enables your business to further enhance its productivity, streamline operations, and solve critical issues quickly. Since an MSP is in touch with various competent agencies, they have the right resources and manpower to help your business achieve new heights. Basically, MSPs end up being a boon if you want to smoothly streamline business operations. Read ahead for some of the key benefits they offer to companies today.
Cost-effective
Managed services help you lower labor costs as well as eliminate the huge costs required to hire and train more IT employees. With our access to new technologies, vast IT resources, and large IT personnel - we can give you top-grade IT solutions at standardized prices. In fact, At IDC Technologies - we also provide clear transparency when it comes to labor fees and cost savings.
Access to top notch expertise
Many SMEs (small and medium businesses) usually have a small or even a one-person IT team that often proves to be inadequate in solving problems that require new technologies and the needed experience. MSPs on the other hand, have access to tons of experienced IT consultants and specialists who will solve your IT business problems for you quickly and efficiently.
Handle non-core business tasks
As your business grows, your IT issues and management needs keep growing too! This is where you may be forced to assign additional tasks to your non-IT employees to keep things streamlined. As IT service providers - we provide a solution to this problem by handling all your non-core business tasks such as streamlining invoicing or workforce planning. This leaves your employees to focus only on core objective tasks to further grow your business.
Proactive approach to system maintenance
MSPs take a proactive approach as they remotely monitor and structurally manage all your systems to diagnose and troubleshoot potential problems. A good managed IT service provider maintains all your systems for you so that you do not have to worry about future maintenance issues and network downtime. In fact, you even end up saving a lot of money as downtime is known to cost businesses significant amounts in the long run.
Cyber Security and compliance checks
As third party agencies, we are totally accountable to ensure data safety, thus we strive to provide you with security both online and offline! We provide specialized focus on network security, acting as a shield between your data and cybercrime. We develop strategies as well as train your employees if necessary, to counter cyber threats such as spam, malware, phishing, and identity theft. While staffing for businesses - we also do robust compliance checks and thorough background checks to ensure that you hire the right fit for your organization.
Round the clock support
As an MSP, it is our job to ensure that you get quick resolutions for your business problems. Because we offer round the clock support in multiple time zones, it becomes easy for businesses to get the required aid whenever they need it. In fact, our consultants even offer you efficient solutions within a 24-hour turnaround time!
Single reliable point of contact
At IDC Technologies, we ensure that you do not have to interact with too many people to get the job done! As a managed service provider - we provide specialized teams led by a single manager who will be your reliable point of contact. This single point of contact serves as a middleman, ensuring that your issues get heard and resolved quickly.

Home Blog How Does IT Consulting Services Drive Business Growth?

How does IT Consulting Services drive Business Growth?
With each passing decade, the IT industry keeps progressing with phenomenal innovations being made in how we interact with the world today. Businesses, especially find the need to stay updated to keep up with the constant changes in technology for smooth operations. 
This is where IT consulting companies come into play as they can offer a wide range of network and technological services that specifically cater to the unique needs of a business. Read ahead as we give you an overview as to how these agencies quickly solve technical issues and help companies to boom incredibly in the business world.
1. Matchless IT expertise
When you hire an IT consulting agency - it brings the expertise of an entire team of specialists right to your doorstep. These experts ensure that you use the most updated and effective technologies according to your diverse business requirements. This proves to be more valuable than separately hiring a single IT expert for your organisation.
For example - at IDC Technologies, we hire around more than 200 IT experts each month who offer businesses skill support in areas such as Infrastructure & Security, Web Technologies, Mobility, Testing, ERP, and Mainframe.
2. Cost Effective
It requires immense time, energy, and money to build an entire in-house IT team for your organisation. On the other hand, when you work with an IT consulting company, you save on taxes and expenses that are incurred on hiring full-time IT professionals.
Besides, IT consultants can be paid as per projects or on an hourly basis. This helps businesses to manage costs effectively and instead focus their financial resources towards other aspects of the business. This is why, IT consulting agencies have proven to be a boon for most companies, especially small to mid-businesses.
3. Enhance Productivity
Technology allows for effective communication, collaboration and knowledge sharing in your organisation. What IT consulting companies do is choose the right technology needed for your business to function smoothly. For example, the use of chatbots by businesses have now simplified the process of interacting with customers.
The task of such agencies is end-to-end which involves planning, installing, and maintaining these systems for you. They reorganise process systems, automate tasks, and take care of repetitive work such as data backups so that your staff is instead better utilised towards growing the company’s profits. This streamlines your business operations and enhances productivity.
4. Aid in Cyber Security
In a world where everything is now online, IT consultants try to act as a shield between your data and cybercrime. Once a data breach has happened, it costs an immense amount of money towards rebuilding a business along with its reputation! This is why businesses especially, cannot afford to be without network security policies and processes in place today.
IT consulting agencies provide specialised focus on network security and prove to be an immense help in protecting your data. They can also train your staff to identify and deal with cyber threats such as spam, malware, phishing, and identity theft.
Now that you've gotten an overview of what an IT consulting service does for businesses, you may choose the one that suits the needs of your company. So how do you know which company is suitable for your business?
While choosing one - it is quite crucial to have a look at their core ethics, experience, certifications, and previous work. At IDC Technologies - we are proud to boast of strong ethics, quick turn-around policy, work that speaks for itself and 13 years of solid experience in the industry. Click to know more.

What does an IT consultant actually do?
The right use of technology is one of the major reasons why the world's top businesses continue to achieve new heights today! This is where IT consultants play a huge role as they diagnose the problems of a particular business, provide effective solutions and thus drive them towards growth. Such consultants are professional experts in a particular field and are often hired by IT consulting companies that help bring their immense expertise to your door. Here are some IT domains which require the services of IT consultants:
Infrastructure
Web Technologies
Mobility and Testing
ERP and Mainframe
Cloud services
Cyber security and compliance
Disaster management

At IDC Technologies consulting technologies too, we hire around more than 200 IT experts each month who offer skill support in all these areas to different businesses. These professional consultants are not only experts at what they do but also excel at communicating with top management of companies to solve their IT problems today. Read ahead to know the scope of work that IT consultants usually do for businesses.

IT consultants are brought in majorly to analyse and then solve major technical problems of a business.
Based on their analyses, they suggest better software or hardware solutions for businesses. This can be any range of systems that help improve the flow of information in the company or systems which better organise files online to save extra manual labour.
These consultants also often focus on solutions that reduce the workload of your employees and instead enhance their productivity towards the core functions of your business.
They are also brought in to set up top grade technology that is also cost-effective for your business. These experts then seamlessly integrate and even maintain these IT systems throughout all the departments in a company to streamline company operations.
IT consultants also specialise in the field of cyber security. They do frequent security checks as well as help to maintain network and data security. Sometimes, they may even train your staff on countering cyber threats such as phishing etc.
They are also immensely useful while doing big data analysis. This helps to find the most optimum way to collect and analyse data of the customers of a business. IT consultants then, make this information easily accessible to your company, especially when it is needed for running campaigns.
They also do crucial risk assessments, maintain documentation, and show progress reports that can later be used for company analysis.

As the field of technology is constantly growing, you will find that there are even more roles where IT consultants are required to bring in their expertise. This is why IT consulting services have become quite the norm now as many small and medium-sized companies majorly depend on such agencies for their IT solutions, instead of spending huge amounts to hire an entire in-house IT team.

Since the last year, IDC Technologies has been on the journey with me, of transitioning from Ausnet to Wipro as a contractor while relocating from Australia to Singapore. Even with all the complications, it’s been an easy and seamless onboarding. Thank you for all the support.

Case Studies
A multinational media group centralizing its employees for efficiency and cost savings
The Problem
One of the world's major media groups needed to centralize its contingent labor management operations in India to gain greater visibility into its workforce, maximize efficiencies, and realize considerable cost savings.
The Solution
To meet the client’s far-reaching needs, IDC Technologies designed a holistic Workforce Solutions program. This allowed the team and client to leverage the capabilities and competencies of a large group of specialists provided by our manpower solution. Team composition includes operational support for time and material and SOW engagements, strategic initiatives, and business intelligence. The team developed a comprehensive solution focused first on supplier optimization. To drive quality standards, the team introduced best practices, including scorecards and rules of engagement.
The team collaborated with the client on a supplier rationalization project to reduce total supplier volume and develop a higher-quality vendor pool. The team began by identifying low-engagement suppliers (those who have submitted no proposals or have responded to a very small number of requisitions). Reducing the overall number of suppliers provided opportunity for cost savings, increased efficiencies, and higher quality, in addition to generating a more manageable list.
The Outcome
 1. A 32% reduction in the supplier pool was necessary to achieve cost effectiveness.
 2. With improved and enhanced communication skills, that led to rapid candidate closures, with a 2-hour request-to-submission time
 3. By reducing the time spent on short lists throughout the hiring process, we were able to draw in the top prospects.
 4. Successfully attracted top notch talent in fields like NLP, BI/BO, AI/ML, and data science.
The Success
By expanding the talent pool, we enabled the organization to hire faster, hire better, pay less per hire, hire more diversely, and future-proof the company.

Transforming University Operations: Enhancing Data Security, Productivity, And Cost-Efficiency.
The university was using an outdated IT network platform that was no longer able to meet their needs. They were outsourcing their IT needs to a third-party subcontractor, and their data was being stored on their premises. They also needed to increase security on their remote server.

When the pandemic struck, the university was forced to close its campus and move all staff and students to remote learning. However, they had no means of accessing their data remotely, leaving the entire team disconnected from the office and unable to work.


The university faced a number of challenges in migrating to the cloud and improving their data security. These challenges included:
The university's data was spread across multiple locations, making it difficult to migrate to a single cloud platform.
The university's staff were not familiar with using cloud-based applications, so they needed training on how to use the new system.
The university's IT infrastructure was not designed to support remote working, so they needed to make significant changes to their network.
Migrating the university's data to a single cloud platform.
Implementing a new security solution that would protect the university's data.
Providing training to the university's staff on how to use the new cloud-based applications.
Making changes to the university's IT infrastructure to support remote working.


The project had a significant impact on the university's overall operations. The university was able to continue providing education to its students during the pandemic, and they were able to reduce their IT costs. The project also helped the university to improve its data security and increase its staff productivity.


The university's commitment to the project.
The university's commitment to the project.
The close collaboration between the university and IDC.


IT costs reduced by 20%.
Data security improved by 50%.
Staff productivity increased by 10%.
Student satisfaction increased by 20%.
